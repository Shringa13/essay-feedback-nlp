According to the same article, 35% know the risk but continue using their phones while on the road. This shows that its beyond dangerous and irresponsible of drivers not to be fully aware of their surroundings while driving. Drivers should be able to concentrate without any distractions, because it could be fatal.According to another article, \"Distracted Driving\" by the NHTSA, there has already been about 3,000 phone related car accident deaths since 2017. The article states that teen get too distracted with their phones, which causes their accident. Accidents that can be easily avoided by focusing on the road and not a phone. Drivers should not be able to use their phones at all while driving.   \n",

Taking other peoples advice and doing what they say may lead to a great outcome. When you receive other opinions whether they are good or bad you will be able to look at them from a different point of view. For example, When a group of people give you advice on yourself, you then know how they look at you as a person. Everyone looks at certain things from a different prospective. How someone else looks at it may be how its supposed to be viewed in life.\\n\\nIn conclusion, You can learn from others experiences by seeking the advice that someone give you.
