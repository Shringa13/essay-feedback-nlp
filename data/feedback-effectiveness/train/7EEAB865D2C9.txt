Have you ever thought you seen something and you look really close and it's something else? Or have you thought something was one thing but it was different? That's what they think happend with Mars. They think there is aliens and that aliens are making faces.

I think people are going crazy. People are watching to many cartoons and they are starting to think that aliens are real. People on talk shows, books, and magazines are talking about it. There is a face on mars and they think it's aliens creating them. I think they it just happend from natural landform. To me it looks like an Egyptian-style pyramid. I didn't see any aliens in the photograph. There aren't homes where they could live. At first scientists thought that it was a Martian mesa, because that is common around that area.

What do you think about the whole thing? I think that people need to go up to mars and really see what is going on. So, we can go and show everyone this there aren't any aliens, and they are just a myth.
