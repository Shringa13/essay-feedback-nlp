Dear Principal, l believe that all students should perform community service .I believe this because we are handed opportunities to make our world a better place, an i think community service is one way to do it. We should take this opportunity by storm. We can be helping a lot of people an communities. I also think if kid do community service it will make them a better person in the future. They will see all the people they helped all the places they fixed an all the plant an animals habitats they saved. I think community service is a great thing for communities, people, plants an animals an the kids their self. We can make this world a better place for the generations to come. Kids mite think your being unfair now but they will thank you for it latter. This is a great opportunity. So i encourages you to require all students to perform community service. I think they can learn a lot from it.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
