Dear: principal

I think students should be required to take a position on whether students should be required to perform community service because they can learn more better education by just being apart of something achieving in life as in doing their school work, getting good grades, being dedicated and representable to the respect in the school policy. and other ways representable student could be held as loyal and helpful students in our school areas. and i also think students should really take a thoughtful moment about rather the community service activity should or would waste their quality time at home just wasting a lot of time ands not really learning about anything important. and i think that it is right to establish that all kids should be required in cleaning up all of the junk that has been abandoned our important community. and i also believe that students should do the right thing and pick up of what they have done as in throwing trash on the ground and thinking it is cool, i don't believe deep down inside that kids and adults should trash and liter up our community like this. and i truly possibly think that kids should think about keeping our environment clean and be supportive.

sincerely, TEACHER_NAME
