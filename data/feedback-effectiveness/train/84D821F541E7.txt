Some school offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online video conferencing. It could be better for kids who have problems learning and sitting still.

Some school should offer that because it could help people with anixty. People who have anixty cant deal with alot of people. They so freak out about small places and freak out of the littles things. People with depression struggle with there self they aren't confroble with body. They also stop eating or stop caring about thingd. People with depression cut there self to help with the pain.

School shouldnt offer this because people wont make any friends. Kids can play sports in school. They can play soccer,baseball,softball,football bakestball,cheer,golf and wrestle. Some familys cant afford to buy food for there famliy. Some kids only get one meal a day. My school gets bags every friday and sends it home with kids so they can eat. Kids who play sports are working out and always on the go. They loose weight when they are working out. Its really good for your body. Kids wont do their homework if they arent here. Some kids learn better one on one but others dont. Some kids are hands on and others are verbial learns. When kids get kick out they do work online. Some kids do collage classes. some kids get to leave school early for work but they are taking that a way.

Some school offer distance learing as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. I dont think it is a good idea at all. Kids will get in trouble and other things. I dont like school that much but it keeps me safe durning the day. Im glad i have this to learn from.Â
