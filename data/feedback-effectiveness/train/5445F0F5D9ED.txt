With this new process in voting for the president called electoral college it would be a new start to voting history.''The electoral college avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate recieves a majority of the votes cast''. This would mean no candidates wins with more votes. With this new method of voting it can be critisized about selecting a president who cannot run this country. Both candidates running for president has either his or her own team of electors who all have there own unique job as a party.

But with this system it can cause problems with bugs, viruses, and etc. People often ask whats wrong with the electoral college? ''Under the electoral college system,voters vote not for the president,but for a slate of electors,who in turn elect the president''. The new voting system is not fair to voters. Because of the winner takes all in each state. ''Its official: The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational. The best arguments in favor of it are mostly asserrtions without much basis in reality. And the arguments against direct elections are spurious at times at best. Its hard to say this, but Bob Dole was right: Abolish the elctoral college!''.

Dispite the electoral college method voting is still possible. The reason is that the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College is because it eceeds the presidents votes. Most states have a winner take all method to figure out who represents your state. It would work but it would be very different then our old presidentual voting.

So with the electoral college method, i think it should be abolished. Only because we dont need a change in our voting system and to have more than one president.''It can be argued that the Electoral College method of selecting the president may turn off potential voters for a candidatewho cannot run a state''. So oters can expresss a political preference rather than people a candidate who lost a election by a single vote.
