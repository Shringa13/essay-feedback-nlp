Dear Senator,

I have written this letter to you to illistatrate how i disagree this situation with the electoral college. I think you are still giving the president to much power still. By this i mean we should have the right as people i which ever stateto vote for our electors. Having the pesident choose for us although we choose the president to represent us on the first place,amd then theres also the situation that we can vote for our elector but we may often get confused and rhem choos e the wrong one. The biggest statement against this so far would be something that we may all know by its name (The Disaster Factor).What? you've never heard of it well let me help you. To start you of you shoould consider yourself lucky it was the biggest election crisis in a century. The worst thing that frightens me is just knowing that even though the legislatur is responsible for picking the electors, the electors have the choice to defy us the as the people. If you think thats the worst honey you should know thats not even half of it,theres also how its unfair to voters because of its winner-take-all system. This system states that in each state candidates dont spend time in states they know they have no chance in winning. IN conclusion keeping the electoral college will be unfair and unjust to us people.

Scincerly; PROPER_NAME
