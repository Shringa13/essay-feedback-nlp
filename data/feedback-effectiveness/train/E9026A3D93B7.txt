Dear Principal,

I believe that you should have the students perform community service. I think that community service is very important but some of the other students think it is a complete waste of time. So I would like to add a "trash clean-up" project for the students who do nothing, or want to help out the school during recess time. It will be on or around campus during the lunch period for fifteen minutes a day. Then the next few days after the school is cleaned up, we should have "reading buddies" for students in preschool and kindergarten. it will give younger students a larger vocabulary, and give the older students higher social skills. I clean up the playground during recess, read to students, and I bake cookies for the elderly people at the local retirement home.

They can do those for the community service you want the students to do at school, and give us a better outlook on life.

Thank you,

A student.
