The author suggest Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the danger it presents and i completly agree with that . But im here to prove why his idea is valuable and correct.

The author supported his idea in many ways but one way he really showed me how well it was supported was when the article stated "Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size, and occasionally the closest in distance too". What the author is trying to prove with this is the danger despite it presents by being really close to earth. Something else that is really important for us to know is the speed and space. Yea it might not be as important but the author wrote it because he thought it was something important to know . What he means with speed and space is that, With speed it means that sometime Venus is closer to Earth but also sometimes Mars is closer and this because the rate of speed going through. In space is the numerous spacecraft to land on this cloud-draped world because of humans.
