I think we should change to election by popular vote for the president of the United States. I have a couple reasons for saying that. First, under the electoral college system, voters don't vote for the president, they vote for a slate of electors who ends up voting for the president. Second, you have to worry about the ties in the electoral vote.

First off, under the electoral college system, voters don't vote for the president, they vote for a slate of electors who ends up voting for the president. So that means you actually don't get to vote for the president you want, the electors get to vote for theÂ  president they want and their choice might not be the same as yours. Here's an example that was in Source 1, "If you lived in Texas, for instance, and wanted to vote for [John] Kerry, you'd vote for a slate of 34 Democratic electors pledged to Kerry." So you don't actually get to vote for a president. Also, in source 2, it states that the electoral college is unfair to voters because of how each state has the winner-take-all system, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance in winning, focusing only on the tight races in the "swing" states.

Second, you have to worry about the ties in electoral vote. Source 2 states that if a tie happens, the election would be thrown to the House of Representatives, where state delegations vote on the president. The senate would choose the vice-president. The state delegations may not vote for the president you want and the senate may not vote for the vice-president you want either.

I think the Electoral College process is a bad idea and it should be changed to popular vote for the president of the United States. Electoral college is unfair to voters and I think it should be gotten rid of.
