In the article "Making Mona Lisa Smile," a man creates a program that can detect human emotion. That man is Professor Thomas Huang. The program he created can detect on how a person is truly feeling. I only know 6 emotions so far and they are happiness, anger, sadness, surprise, fear, and disgust. The program could lead to major scientific/artistic break throughs.

The program uses muscle identification to determine what emotion the person is making. A specific muscle is used to make an emotion. For example, the zygomatic major is used to move the lips up to make a smile. The zygomatic major and the risorius is used to force a smile like if you feel awkward, depressed, or upset but doesn't want to show it. So even the program can tell if you are forcing a smile or you are actually happily smiling.

Expressing emotions everyday could improve how you actually feel and you may get more out of life than you would with a straight face. People will think you are are happy if you smile, sad if you frown, content if you have a straight face, etc. People analyze how you are feeling to share iin your happiness, make you feel better so you are no longer sad, and calm you down if you are angry. With this program, people can now understand human emotions better than than naked eye. This kind of program could be used in therapy sessions, doctor's offices, and hospitals.
