Nowadays it have been many car accidents and deaths due to driving while distracted. The main distraction is your own phone. and to me I think this should completely changed around and make it to the point where they should take away when driving. I will talking on why I think the people should stop driving and using they phone.

The reasons why cell phones should not be used while driving are fairly obvious, because even a two-second distraction - taking your eyes off the road to pick up your phone and see who's calling you.

Opponents say that cell phones are good because they give an opportunity to make a call in case of emergency. However, it is illusion of safety because when people need it the most either they can't find it or reach it because they are stuck in car. People shouldn't fully depend on cell phones because they are not reliable,

It turns out that cellphone-use-while-driving laws vary depending on the state that you're in. If you're on a road trip across state lines, troopers might be able to pull you over for something that may be perfectly legal in your home state. You should also be aware of how distracted the other drivers around you might be.

So as you see all the facts of you shouldn't have your phone while driving have just been justified. Knowing that not only your life is in danger the next person life's in danger. And hop that this can spark a new beginning of getting driving while distracted ban.
