Dear Principal,

I think it fair that kids who have a B average should choose a sport but kids how have F. Should not be able to choose a sport because then they worried more about there sport. Then about school or school work then they don't have time to do there homework. Then they might even fail the grade there in. But people who have a B should be able to choose a sport because there doing well in school. And not failing in school there tried hard so they should be able to choose a sport that they like. But if they start doing bad in school or not doing there homework and start to get an F they should talk to the student. And tell him/her if they have a sport and still have

B average or in the next test they take and get an F. there going to have take away there sport till she /he has better grades.
