At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters. The winner take all system in each state candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning. Focusing only on tight races in the swing states. During 2000 campaign,seventeen states did not get to witness they're candidates. Including Rhode island and South Carolina. Voters in 25 of the largest media markets didn't get to see a single ad.

State senator we need to get rid of Electoral College and upgrade to popular vote. It's just not fair. That's not very perfessional at all. what's the point of having electoral college if they do not show up. Thats a horrible look for not just you but them too. Either yall need to get a understanding or move on up to popular voting.

I have a question. When citizens vote in electoral college why do their votes go straight to the candidates and not the president? Sound very fishy if you ask me. This is about the president of our country and it's not being taken seriously.

See with the popular vote they go straight to the president and not a scam like eletoral vote. It's more confidental if your really serious about your president. Now what if the wrong president get picked? Then what? High bills,going up on gas,harder to get hired.       Â
