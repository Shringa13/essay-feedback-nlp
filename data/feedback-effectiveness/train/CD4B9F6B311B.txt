The author presents the idea of exploring Venus well. But what about walking on the surface to explore from the space craft? If we could walk on the planet without being harmed by all of the outside forces, then we coulf run more tests.

In the passage, the author states,"Each mission to Venus was unmanned because none of the spacecrafts have survived landing." These factors show that with the materials we have, we should be going for a safer planet like the moon or mars. The author also states that the planet atmosphere is 97 percent carbon dioxide with highly corrosive clouds. This shows that most metals we have can be melted by the clouds and the temperature at the surface is too much for a human to handle.

Like I said in the intro, If we had the materials to keep a human safe to walk on the planet and take samples. We would have plenty of things to test here on Earth. Venus also has the hottest surface temperature in the solar system. If we could find a way to keep the hot air out and the cool air in, we could do it.

In conclusion, scientists should not be looking into trying to land on Venus. There are too many risk factors to take and we don't have the resources.
