If the school principal wants to change the cell phone rules , then i think it would be a better idea that she lets the students have cell phones at their lunch period and other free time but make them shut the phones off in class. I think that's better because the students already bring in phones and use then during class while the teacher isn't looking or not paying attention. But , if the principal lets the students use their cell phones at lunch or free time in school then they wont have to hide anything from the teacher and be sneaky , some students do do that and if they get caught , they get in a lot of trouble. If the rule is NOT to use the cell phones then i don't get why they do it anyway , there isn't even ever anytime to text someone while in class because the teachers always keep us all busy. If one of the students get caught , you have to tell your parent to go up to the school and go get it. I would find it fair and better if the principal let us use our phones in school , just not in class. I always get in trouble for taking my phone out when i get OUT of school just because I'm still on the "school grounds." They don't do anything about anyone taking their phones out after school if they see you they just ask you nicely to not use it or put it away while on school grounds.

If it was an emergency I'm sure they would let you use your phone or any phone. I don't think the principal would never give you a hard time about your phone being out on school grounds if it was an emergency or something important. But , from my opinion , it think it would be a better idea to just let the students use their phones in their free time. I think all the students would be very happy with that and agree with it , that way they don't have to get in trouble for texting and being accused of being a bad kid because they were texting in class. That's no fair if you get in trouble but mean while if you have free time why not use your phones while you can.?
