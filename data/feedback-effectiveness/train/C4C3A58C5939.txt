Venus is dangerous because its one of the closes starts to the sun. Since venus is so close to it makes it the second hottest planet in space. Its hard for them to examine it closely because how hot it could be on the planet so the sit safe at a certain vantage point.

Venus is close to earth witch makes itthe twin like in terms of density and size its close but distant a little from venus. So say if we get close to the sun earth woukd basically be like venus. Venus and earth is right around the corner from eachother so wat makes it different from eachother shouldnt the earth be hot too. To really think about it hot would it be if we were like venus.

The atmosphere is 97 perdent of carbon dioxide blankets venus which could really explain where the heat come from or take place in. Theres acid in venus atmosphere the pressure is 90 times worst than what it would usally be on earth. Its over 800 degress on that plante which makes it a baby sum or the son of sun. Venus has one if the worst tempature ever it gets so hot that it woukd kill us humans in a instant if we think about it. But they said venus is like the earth twin. So do you think that it was once life on that plantet before in the past and the sun ruined it so there no more life everything is excint on that planet.
