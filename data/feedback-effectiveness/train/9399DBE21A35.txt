Why would you want to limit car usage. When you use your car people are making money. People need a car to far away places fast. cars are expensive, thats because people keep adding on to it and making it more fancy and of corse its going to be more expencive.

If you limit cars most gas stations would be going out of bussniess and car places. gas stations buy the gas for cars to use yeah the gas is expensive but we need it and car dealerships would have so many cars they wouldnt know what to do with them cause no one would but them because there car would be limited to use so there car would be brand new. yes people are losseing alot of money from cars but its worth it cause we need to get places. if you make cars fancy yeah your going to have people to want to buy it but thats because you want them to buy it cars are killing the envirnment up though because the gas the people tearing into there grass people dont relize it but cars should just be used to get places and then stay there and then when there done go home. i mean if they can make a car that can scene if there drunk and wont start i would buy that car because it would tell you not to drive becaus eyou are drunk that will slove so many deaths and drunk driver accident problems. instead of making cars fast and look slicker and nicer and have the car talk to you with blootooth thats just dumb in my opion i wish they would just make cars more reasonable with things that really matter than just look nicer and more for rich people alot of people can afford cars so they should lower all prices and they would make more money becaus emore stuff will be sold like the drunk deceter carÂ
