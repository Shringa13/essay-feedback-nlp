Hey,how are you today. Well I am here today to tell you why it would be a great idea for you to participate in the Seagoing program.

The reason i think it would be a great idea for you to participate in the Seagong program is because I just got done reading a artical called,'' A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves,''.And in this story the author gave me many reasons on why it would be a great idea to participate in the program.

The first reason on why it would be great is if u enjoy caring fo animals then the Seagoing Cowboys program is the place for you. The reason i say this is because the UNRRA hired''Seagoing Cowboys'' to take care of the horses,young cows,and mules that were shipped overseas.

Another reason on why it would be a great idea is the experience to visit many unique places,for example if u like to travel and visit places you can have the side benefit of seeing Europe and China or even better you can see the special sight of the Acropolis in Greece. Also you can take a gondola ride in Venice,Italy,which is a city with streets of water. Another great thing about it is that you can tour a excavated castle in Crete and marvel at the Panama Canal on your way to China. But if your lazy and non disaplined i dont think this is a good trip for you because you have to be prepared for hard work .

One other reason on why it would be a great idea is because if you like to have fun and enjoy yourself than this would be great for you because you can find time to have fun on board,especially on return trips after the animals have been unloaded. The cowboys play baseball and volleyball games in the empty holds where animals had been housed. Table-tennis tournaments,fencing,boxing,reading,whittling,and games also helped pass the time.
