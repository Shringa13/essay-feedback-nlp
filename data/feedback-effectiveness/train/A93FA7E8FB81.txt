I believe that the electoral college should be changed and be ended oncce and for all.

I think that the electoral college is a certain way of cheating in a presidency that you dont want to win. When people in the states vote for a new president they're giving all of they're votes to the electors. This is one of the biggest reasons I think its not fair. They're trusting the elecotrs with all of they're votes when they dont even know who the electors will vote for.

Almost nobody in the states even know's who the electors are. Why should everyone be putting they're trust with votes into people they dont know? Even when I read the passage I saw that the electors could possibly get confused and vote the wrong way and if many of them end up doing that you can ultimately end up with the wrong president.

Another big flaw that the electoral college consists of is what if it does end up getting a tie? then we would have to pass it all onto the House of Represenatives. If the house of rep, end up picking the wrong president, it could be even worse. I'm personally not into politics but I can already tell that if I was I would hate the electoral college, I dont even understand how you couldn't.

The electoral college I feel is something that first started out helping the elections for when it was first created but has changed massively over time, and it hasn't changed in a good way at all. It's almost as if our own american citizens can pick they're president. We have to leave that all up to our electors, which I dont this is FAIR at all to all our voters.

If it wasn't for our electoral college, we would've never had George W. Bush as are president. He didn't even get the most votes! but since our electoral college can vote for whoever he ended up winning anyways. I think this topic is obviously a one sided question cause there's obviously a right answer here. Abolish the electoral college!
