That Venus is the closest plant to earth,almost has the same density and size to earth but is the second planet away from the sun. It can go up to 800 degress fahrenheit on a average scale has 90 times more atmospheric pressure than earth can crush a submarine that is bulit to wistand the water pressure deep below. Venus is more hotter than mercury which is the closest plant to the sun has erupting volcanoes,powerful earthquakes,and frequent lightning dispiet the harsh elements and lack of life support. Has some similary features to earth like valleys,mountains,and craters. NASA is planing to send humans to Venus to study it's natural elements to see if it's suitable for humans.

NASA is still planing on making a trip to Venus but it will be a diffuclt change to acivemen do to it's harsh climate. Their plan is to sent scientists to float above the landscape. But the ship orbiting above the planet can only provide limited sight on the ground because most light couldn't go through the dense of the atmosphere. They could not take any miterals from Venus they have to get up close and personal to the ground dispiet the harsh cilmate. Solar power would be plentiful and radiation would not exceed Earth levels not easy conditions but should be survivable for humans.
