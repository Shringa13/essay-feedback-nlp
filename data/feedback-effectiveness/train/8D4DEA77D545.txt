Venus is ideal for humaninty, if Earth became not ideal for humaninty anymore. The previous article about Venus " The Challenge of Exploring Venus" is a good article to read, because it describes Venus and it's dangers and it's benfits. It may be mistaken that it is unhabitable for humanity, but there is a possiblity for humanity to live on other planet. There is reasons for saying those things about Venus. This is an other aticle to explain why Venus is habitable for humanity.

"Venus is often referred to as Earth's twin" Paragraph 2, is perfect arguement to start with, because as you can see venus is already considered as twin of Earth. It's natural geographic is similar to Earth's, so it already proves Venus could had a possibility of having oceans, lake, and bodies of water in the past. The density and size is same to Earth too so we will have vaguely same space as Earth. Venus is too hot to survive so we can do blimp-like vehicle above venus and still stay in their gravity and have people survive in the atmosphere above the fray. We could send people over there to research first before doing anything, If they makes people feels safer about living on Venus.

There is reason for saying those things about Venus, the reason for saying those things are that we are currently overpopulating Earth we currently have over 7 Billion people living. We need more room for more people in the future and im concered if we dont move to other planet, Earth will be crowded. It already is crowded in some areas of Earth, like New York, California, New Delhi, and more. "Our travels on earth and beyond should be not limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edge of imagination and innovation." Is a good statment to make to encourage people to explore Venus more. There is some people who hope that we will move to other planet.
