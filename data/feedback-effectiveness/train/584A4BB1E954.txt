Should these summer projects be teacher-designed or student-designed ? I think students should designed. students can do this well.

One reason why summer projects from students. Because if the student designed their project they can choose their projects. For example, some students need an essay project but teachers give harder projects for students and they can't do this projects. And some students not have idea about the projects from teachers but when students choose their projects they have good ideas about their projects. However, some teachers did not like to students choose their projects .This is not the only reason summer projects from students is good.

Some may argue summer projects from teachers is good. This is because the teachers have more information about summer projects and they know what kind of projects is better for students. However, some students not have information about summer projects and they did not like to complete the summer projects from teachers in the summer.

In conclusion, I think the students need to choose their projects because if they choose their projects they like the summer projects and they really want to complete their projects in the summer vacation and they have good ideas about the projects.
