your principal has decided that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity. for example, students could participate in sports, work on the yearbook, or serve on the student council. do you agree or disagree with this decision? use specific details and examples to convince others support your position.

i agree because students who do not like to do sports or anything at all its good for them to do something to keep them busy and occupied. And someone should at least convince them to try something new in sports.

when i was younger my mom always told me that i should do basketball. Because i wasn't doing a after school sport at all and i didnt like sports at the time. So we talked about doing it and i tried it i kind of liked it it was fun because of the basketball drills and got to meet new friends on the team. after that i started doing flag football, and tackle football and i enjoyed it and i was always busy and occupied.

i think students who don't do any sports should try it. because it will keep you busy and you would enjoy it because you meet new friends and its very competitive. other than that it will keep you from being on your phone and staying home all day bored when you can be out having fun playing sports. And also sports would make you think about what you wanna do in the future if you really like sports and good at it. It would also make your family proud of you because of all the hard work you did to get this opportunity. But it also takes time to be good at something only if you try. because thats the only way to get somewhere.
