Why I think that Luke should join the program. I think he should join the program beacause he is a good person in the story. Also I think should because he really does anything bad in the story he just things that won't get him in trouble. But also he is a good child in the story he deserves to be in that program because their is no actual reson he can't be part of that program. Also Luke does really deserve to be in that program because i don't think he has been in any other program in his life as it said in the story. But one thing that really stands out to me is that why cant he be part of that program because their really is no reason that he shouldn't be in that program.

Why Luke should be part of the program. I think that Luke should be part of that program because in the story it said that Luke really wants to be in that program because he has worked his whole life to be in that program. And another one of the reasons I think that he should be in that progrsm because he has worked his whole life for to get that program and also in the story it said that Luke would not give up to get into that program and be part of the program because he thinks that he deserves to be in that program and I think that he is qualified to be on that program.

why I think that Luke should be in that program. He deserves to be in that program because he their is no reason he should't be in that program. He is also a hard worker like it said in the text if I was Luke I would never give up to getting into that academy because if that was my dream I would never stop trying to get into that academy because I want to do something important in my life like join the academy Luke wants to join or be a doctor I never give up on my dreams. that why I think Luke should join that academy.
