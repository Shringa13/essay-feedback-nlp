I think its ok so you can know how the person is feeling. If you know how a person is feeling then you can react to them in a way. The process begins when the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face; all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles. Eckman has classified six basic emotions- happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness. If your in a classroom and you don't have one of those (FACS) then one day a student can come in all calm in the from out of nowhere there's a fight. But with a FACS when that person comes in the room, and the computer scans the person and it shows that the person is angry. Now that the teacher knows that the person is angry an they can see if they can calm them down. In paragraph 6 it's says "a classroom coomputer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored."
