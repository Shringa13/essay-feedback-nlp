Dear, Principal

I believe that all students should be required to do community service, But i also believe that students should not have to be forced to do it, if they choose not to do it then it will be there fault.

The students that have done there community service hours will not have to go though a struggle to do it later in life and that they care to help other will bring good. The ones who choose that they have things better to do then community service they will later in life learn that they should have done it a long time ago. This i something i will be willing to do is because i am smart enough to know that i have a better chance to get a good job faster. I have also thought the ones who is also willing to there community service, some are not able to finds things to do so me and other students and you should get together and help out the ones who are willing but don't know what to do. Like we can set up a rally and other thing that will help to get other going and moving. We can also probably change the minds of others to do things by making it fun for others that is not intesterd.
