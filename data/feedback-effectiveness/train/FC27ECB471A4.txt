I would be on boat and agree to do this in schools because its not a bad idea helps us students get a better education if you really think about it becuase it won't take 30 mins wasting class time on to log in to a computer if you scan your face it would be alot easier to sigh in and get straight to the lesson.

This idea can also help kids because in the text is told us that the computer can read are facial expression and the computer can read all 44 of your face muscles which it can help too see if someone id down and the teachers ca see that the compter is telling them somehting is going on maybe at home or theres a problem going. Maybe this new thing can help stop bullying or seek people with depression and see if that student need help. But how is this face scan going to work in the first place? Well my guess is the camera so then it can stop theif because if someone tried to login without your permission you can see who it was maybe even contact the police.

I would go for this idea just help everything get easier because who knows maybe this can happen and everyone can get a laptop education would be fun and kids would maybe pay attention more so its taking 2 birds with one stone alos can stop kids from horse playing around keep children on task. Maybe even make the teachers job easier.
