First and formost, it is my belief that we should keep the electoral college because,it has been around for so many years so the question is why consider changing it now? The electoral college consists of 538 votes about 270 of electoral votes require them to elect a president too.

In 1976 a tie would have occured if a merge of 5,559 voters from ohio and 3,687 voters in hawaii voted the other way so it is to my belief that we should keep the ectoral college and just let the popular vote idea be a thing of the past and move on. The benifit of having the electoral college is that it is widely regarded as an anachronism, a non democratie method of selecting a president that will handle his job and do what he is supposed to do.

Thirdly,both the electoral college and popular votes are good options but in my opinion i think the electoral college is better and the electoral college has five reason why they are the best. The method is certainity of an outcome,everyones president,swing states,big states and avoid run off election so that is why i think we should keep the electoral method becuase those five reasons make up the lack of democratic pedigree.
