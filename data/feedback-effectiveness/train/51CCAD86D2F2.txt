I think that FACS is very useful technology, that could benefit classrooms everywhere. It, as the article talks about, can help students if there getting lost or bored. By just adjusting it's teaching algorythms to better help the student.

During everyday life, we look at others faces and can most of the time see how they are feeling. If your friend has a frown on their face, then you can try and use comforting tactics and try to help them in anyway. And you use these tactics because you know what they are feeling. And FACS can do the same thing!

If a student is having trouble in school and there learning style might be different. The FACS can adapt to that students learning style or mood. And help them better than just mindlessly teaching them, and not changing anything thats going on.

FACS can be extremely useful in schools all over the world. And can make students and their learning enviroments more flexible and effective. Which in turn with help a gargantuan amount in them having a succeful career. Because students should come first, they are the worlds future. And anything we can do to assist them or better their education, should be done.
