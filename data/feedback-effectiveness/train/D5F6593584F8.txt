Dear principal,

I am asking you why are you changing that the students should have a grade average of a B to play sports that's I am writing to tell you why it should be changed. My first reason is even that the students make a c average in there class they should still play until they fail the class.

My second reason is when someone get injured and where is his back up oh wait he's not here because he is studying at home and he has a C average in he math class. My third reason when he not here playing we have to forfeit the game because its your fault and everyone will boo at you. My fourth reason is people like to play sports and when they don't they get mad at you because they failed in there class. So I gave you reasons why you shouldn't change the sports play to a B average you should have make it until they fail at least.

sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME

p. s. oh and you better fast before the student's start a strike and you get in trouble for all of this havoc you caused
