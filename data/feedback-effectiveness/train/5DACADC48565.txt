What does one do when they need advice fro something? Many people go to their friends or family for advice.

Its always good to get more than one opinion on something especially for tough choices.

Although one might not get the response they want; its always good to hear others opinions. Theres many reasons why seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice including, getting different points of view, better understandings of the situation, and better options.

To start off, getting different points of views is what many people do. Whether it involves big choices like buying a house or if its small things like picking out a dress for prom. Decisions dont always come easy and getting advice from multiple people help with it. Although one may dislike someones opinion it can actually help them because now thats lowered their choices and made it easier to choose from.

Second, getting a better understanding of the situation from someone also helps make a better choice. The more information you have on something the easier it will be for making a choice. One might think they know everything but they dont and, that's okay. The more people one ask for advice from people the more knowledge they will gain so, its easier to make a choice.

Finally, getting advice from multiple people can open up way better options and new ideas. When one helps someone out they could show them choices they never thought of that are way better than the choices they have now. Better options will come if you have multiple people telling you new ideas and giving you so such more choices.

In conclusion, getting advice from multiple people will help you make better choices. when you ask fro advice you can get different points of views, better understandings of a situation,and better options. In my opinion, I think asking people for advice is great way to make a choice. Next time one needs advice i suggest asking multiple people.
