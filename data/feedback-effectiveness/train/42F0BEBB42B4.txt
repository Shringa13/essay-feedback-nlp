Dear Principal,

I do not think that students should be required to do community service. I believe that it should be a choice but only under certain circumstances. If they choose to be in a club or any other school activity that requires them to do community service then they would have to or be kicked out of that club, if not then they should not have to. The only reason that a student should have to do the community service when they are not in a club is if they got into some kind of trouble at school or during something related to school/on school grounds or if they accumulate so much detention that they don't make up another choice should be community service. Another reason they could do community service is if they want to help out the community but not because they have to do it as punishment or to as curriculum for a club.

One of my examples is that if people that were on a soccer team or any other team did something that got them in trouble and they would not be given detention for is they could do community service instead. Another example is that if a student had accumulated over 24 hours of detention and it was close to the end of the school year or a dance/ field trip that they really wanted to go to was coming up they could just make it up with the amount of community service that you and other faculty members decide is fit for the circumstances. My final example is that a student could have a friend that is having trouble with math and they want to help their friend they do community service and help their friend with whatever he or she would need help with or if they see a park that is full of litter they could help clean it up. Maybe doing that the student could get extra credit to help their grade if they need to push it up a little. Those are some of my reasons that I think a student would have to do community service.

Sincerely,

Student
