The use of technology suchas, Facial Action Coding system, is totally uneccessary in the classroom setting. Claiming that " 'A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored.' " is an ineffective way to to really, truly get through to the students. Instead of focusing on adding more technology to the classroom, maybe giving teachers a better salary and better education would help the teachers teach better, then the students would understand the material better. In the article, it says " we humans perform the same impressive 'calculation' every day". If humans already have this natural ability, then adding more technology into the classroom that teacher could already be doing, is uneccessary and distracting. I am sure there are some upsides to this, but it really just feels like an invasion of the students privacy. In the article is says " ' Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instrucor' "

The teacher can not just modify an entire lesson because one student is confused, that is unfair to the students that understand the lesson already. Instead, the teacher could work with the student individually and help them with what they are having trouble with. All in all, adding more uneccessary technology into the classroom would be distracting to the students and an invaison of their privacy. The "Facial Action Coding system" could be useful somewhere else, just not the classroom.
