Dear, principal or Board of education

Community service, you want children to do community service my opinion for that is they should in some way and in another they shouldn't .

Opinion one in some way the children should help out picking up trash and help with other things grownups cant do it all the time .Sometimes they need help so you should get involved and help out every once in awhile.

Opinion two in some way children should not help out .You have too think children need every minute of their life with education . This cant be during our time of learning that help us when we get older. Children shouldn't do community service not in till they get little bit older . Time is money and money is in our education to go to college and be successful in our everyday lives.

My point is think about what you put off make the right decision see where the children are if they have extra time they could it after school . Otherwise do what's best for you.

sincerely, STUDENT_NAME
