In the article"A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves" Luke helped people in WW l l. When you help others they will help you back. It is nesessary to what it important to others. Some people thinks its funny to watch other contenets to bein war. I don't like to see our allies in war whille we stayed and watched.

When you help others they will help you back in what way they can. It could be anything like helping you with building somethin or perhaps makeing dinner and hangging out. All i kmow is it would be the right thing to do. You could be the one who wants to do them a favor or they do you a favor and you want to help them in a way.

Its important to do what is nesessary. People do what is nesessary for their familys or friends. Mabey even pets. If you don't you might be making a bad choose in what you will do in the future.

When Luke helped people he is doing the right thing. People from WW l l gave their lives to save the place of thins they loved. Even I would give my life for anyone and everyone I cared for. This time he wanted to help them with animals, food, and whatever eals they needed. He played an very important role for the people of Europe.

This shows my reason of Lukes point of view. You should help others when you have a chance and not just sit and watched. I would have volenteered myself to help others in need. He wanted to see the world and have fun al along to help others. This is my argument of the story.
