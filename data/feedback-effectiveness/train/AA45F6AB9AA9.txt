A extracurricular is something you do out of school or maybe it's for a team in school but is something to get you to socialize , meet new friends,being active ,finding something you actually love to do and keeping you entertained

But for some people they do see it in that way and may feel like that is a way to get people out of there comfort zone . That's why if my principal decided to make me do an extracurricular activity I would disagree because some people are too busy and could cause stress, or they don't want to do an activity at school or they already are doing an activity or they not a very social person and thats why I would disagree.

One reason I would disagree is because some people are just way to busy and if principle makes them do an extracurricular activity that might cause stress to them and that could be adding more to their schedule which would be a struggle to maintain all of work I may have to do already especially as child . For example is someone has an activity out of school like dance on Monday and the principle makes them do another activity on that day it would be hard for them to stay after for that activity if she have another place to go already , and that's why that would be adding more to there schedule and would be hard to maintain another example is maybe I have a lot of school work I have to do or I have to study for a test and you don't have time to stay after for an activity that could also cause stress .Thats one reason why I disagree to making people do an extracurricular activity .

another reason I disagree is because some people aren't interested in what the school offers and if the principle makes them do something they don't want to do that would make them feel like they are forced to pick out of options they don't like . Say for example my school only offers basketball ,track and cheer leading ,but I really want to do soft ball that could be forcing me too do a sport I would not like to do . For another example say your school offers languages for and extracurricular activity like french and Spanish but he/she wanted to learn another language that would be be hard for me because maybe I only wanted learn language. That's another reason why I do disagree with making people do extracurricular activities.

The last reason I disagree with making people do extracurricular activities is because maybe i'm he/she is not a very social person and they do not like to meet new people and they are very shy it could make people uncomfortable and nervous .For example he/she is made to join an activity and they feel left out because everyone else has friends and are talking too people they make them feel bad because they are not a social person. Another example is say that may not be a very athletic person and thy have to participate in a sport that could also make them feel like they are forced to do something they would not like to do and make them feel uncomfortable as well ,and thats why I disagree with making people do extracurricular activity .

In conclusion that why if my principle made me do an extracurricular activity I would disagree because he/she might not want to anything in school or he/she are to busy or they not really social people ,and making people do extracurricular activity could cause stress, and more to there schedule and making people feel uncomfortable .That's why strongly disagree with making people do extracurricular activities
