do you thing stuudent would benefit from being able to attend classes from hom?

I sopport the student should be attend class from home because We do not have to go to School and we can have more time with the family also We do not have to wake up early we can saty safe at home.

SD 1. some student do not like to wake up early and they shoose to take the classes online for the reason that student do not to ride the bus and can early to School.

SD 2. In my opinio it is a good idea to take class online most in this time becacuse so many bad thing are happen in the world for Example the corona virus this is one of most reason that I support to attend class at home because We can do the classes online and we can stay at home more safe and healthy.

SD 3. other good reason that is a good idea to take classes in home is that you mom know that you are in home because a lot of students scape and they mom thing that they are inthe School so if peolple attend classes from home mom ready know the his son in home.

conclution some student do not like to use the computer and they shoose to come to School and other student they do not how to use computer but still doing a good idea tke classes at home becasue you can have more time with your family also you don't have to wake up early to ride the bus and you can do you work at home and take more break
