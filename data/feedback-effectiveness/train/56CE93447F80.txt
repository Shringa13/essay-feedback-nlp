Dear senator I am arguing to you in favor of keeping the Electoral College for the voting process of the president. Why I am in favor in keeping the Electoral College is why should we change something that's already working good. The Electoral college system is a system that voters vote not for the president, but for a slate who in turn elect the president. The electors can be anyone not holding public office. Why we should keep it is because we have been using it since 1960 and i dont see why change something that works, is slightly fair, and everybody is happy.

The electoral college is widely regarded as an anachronism, a non-democratic method of selecting a president that ought to be [overruled] by delcaring the candidate who receives the most popular votes the winner. The advocates of this position are correct in arguing that the electoral college method is not democractic in a modern sense.... it is the electors who elect the president, not the people. When tou vote for a presidential candidate you're actually voting for a slate of electors.

The reason is thatr the winning candidate's share of the electoral college incariably exceeds his shares of the popular vote. For example,Obama are likelyeceived 61.7 percent of the electoral vote comparad to only 51.3 percent of the popular votes casr for him and romeney.

The winner take all method of awarding electoral votes induces the candidates as we saw in 2012s election to focus their campaign efforts on the toss up state. Voters int oss up[ states are more likely to pay close attention to the campaignÂ  to really listen to the competting candidatesw knowning that they are going to decide the election they are going to decide the election.
