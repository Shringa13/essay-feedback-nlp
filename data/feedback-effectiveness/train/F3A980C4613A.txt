Have you ever seen something unusual in the ground? If so do you think it was created by humans or just a natural landform of some sort. Many people believe that most landforms on earth are made by humans, The face on mars is a natural landform.

If the "face' on mars was created by alliens it would look a lot different. Many people think alliens look weird, Well the "face" on mars wastn't so weird looking. It looked almost like a human face. You would think that alliens would make something radical and not just a face in their planet. Many people seem to believe that they would make something simple.

Eventhough many people were not satisfied with the theory that NASA gave them, NASA went on to search for more clues as to which "alliens made the landform." From the pictures that they took you would think that they would be able to detect whether alliens even walked/ touched the surface of the landform.

If you think that alliens made the landform, I would suggest you look at the picture more closely. Just because its on a planet like mars doesnt mean it was made by an allien. I mean how many people actually believe in alliens anyway? If you've never seen them how do you know if they even exist? Take another quick look at the picture tell what you think. Is it even possible for alliens to be alive even if it is on another planet?

The "face" on mars is a natural landform. What leads me to beieve that, is that i dont think alliens are real. Maybe they are real, but why would they make something so simple as a face. Dont you think they wouldve went a little overboard with their creations?
