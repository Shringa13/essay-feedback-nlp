There are times where you feel like giving up and it seems easier to do so, but if you keep trying your best, you'll make it. The author of "The Challenge of Exploring Venus" is suggesting that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. They are finding/testing new/old technology to get to Venus, using what they know about Venus, and Venus is the closes planet to being Earth-like.

To be able to land and survive on Venus, we'll need to find and test new or old technology. In paragraph 7, it says, "some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus's surface and have lasted for three weeks in such conditions." This shows that they are already testing new methods that could possibly survive on Venus. In paragraph 7, it says, "Another project is looking back to an old technology called mechanical computers...system that use mechanical parts can be made more resistant to pressure, heat, and other forces." This proves that they are using all resources that even date back to the 1800s.

To be able to land on Venus, we'll need to use what we already know about Venus. In paragraph 3, it says, "such environment would crush even a submarine...and would liquefy many metals." This shows that they know that what type of metals they need to use.

Venus is the closes planet to being Earth-like. In paragrapgh 5, it says, "
