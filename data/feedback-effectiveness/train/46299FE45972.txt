The Challenge of Exploring Venus

In this story the author is talking about Venus. Alot of people could care less about the planets but its a big part of the world today. In this story its talking about Venus and everything people need too know about it. I think the author in this passage described Venus well. He/she explained everything about Venus, The size, were its located, how hot it is etc. I think this cause in passage 1,2,3 it gives alot of information on Venus. And the author organized the facts really well by putting alot of facts in each paragraph and focusing on that and giving alot of information on that subject. In paragraph 4 it talks about how Venus is almost like the earth and how maybe one day they would like too visit. This is a huge thing cause if so we could have another planet of life. So in conclusion i think this article was very well planned and had just the right amount of infomation for a average person too learn and know about.
