Venus is a very dangrus planet its ben proven, not one human has lasted more than a few hours floating above the fray,its been more than three decades since a space ship has tuched venus but scientist are till working on the planert wonderingthe same question as you why are we still working on this dangerus planet well scientist come to notice that venus has some familiar featurs alike earth it has vallys, mountains,and craters, scientist have come to think that long time ago, venus was probably coverd with oceans and could have suppoted various forms of life, just like earth today., thats why scientists are not giving up on figuring out venus witch is why they are still trying to go back to venus safe and scientificly productive following the safe orders that NASA gave the scientist, NASA gave sicentist permission to go to venus with some conditions,they will only be allowed to be floating above the fry, scientist will have to invent a stronger space ship, and they will have to study not just the planet but the people more so it can be safer and they dont have any risks. not to mention venusis the closest to earth in terms of desity and size, and occasionatly the closest to didtance too its the second planet from our sun known as erths twin.
