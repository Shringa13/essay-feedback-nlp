When people ask for advice they sometimes talk to more than one person. It is better to talk to more people than just one. The reason why it is always better talk to multiple people is because the more people you talk to the more advice you have. The least people you talk to the less advice you have.

When you talk to a lot of more people you have more varieties of advice to pick the one you want to use. Some people have negative thoughts in there mind and when they ask for advice that can help them out a whole lot. Then when they get a lot of good advice of what to do, and how to not have negative thoughts. This can change there life a whole lot and really help them out.

Whenever someone ask for advice you should always give them it, because you never know what they are going through. Also that advice can be very helpful to them.

When asking for advice you should never ask just one person to get advice from always ask multiple, like family or close friends so it is more choices to pick from.

Some people can be about to do something very bad that can make them go to jail, or hurt themselves. So you have to step up and stop them from doing it by giving them good advice. Therefore, When giving or getting advice always give it to multiple people or receive it from multiple people.
