I think the technologhy to read students emotional spreeions is a great idea because it can tell you if you sad happy angery disgusted or fear. On the Mona Lisa smile it tells you how are you felling when you are looking at it. That ehy people and student go look at the Mona Lisa smile panting to go see how are they filling. In the pragh 1 it says that shes 83 percent happy 9 percent disgusred 6 percent fearful. Dr Huang asked if they can calculate emotions like math homework and how can a computer recongnize the subtle facial.

In this process it begins when the computer constructs a 3-D computer model on the face. Dr huang relies on the work of the pyschologists as Dr Paul Eckman creator of FACS the did the test on Eckman and he had happiness surprise anger disgust fear and sadness. The Mona Lisa demonstration is really intened to bring a smile to eveybody face when you go and see the painting. Making a happy face was a great idea because its bring people happyniess to you becacuse its does not making you angery or sad. that why it was a grat idea about this painting.
