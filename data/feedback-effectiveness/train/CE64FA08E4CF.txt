Dear, Principal

I think students should be required to perform community service. So we can make this world better by cleaning up litter. The most important is teaching kids how to learn. helping them do better in class. We can make students become smarter. Teach them what they need to know. Teach them from wrong to good. They need the education that they are giving. To actually become something in the world. LITTERING! Is everywhere. Papers are on the ground. They throw there trash on the ground like if someone is going to pick it up. So is good that community service make them pick up trash. So they can keep the ground clean. So those who think its important it is. Some people don't have respect for the world they live in. Those who think is bad i guess they like living in a dirty place. But that is a great way to help world. Helping people clean up the streets. Sidewalks that people walk on. Doing the best for are community. So i will like to help do my community service. THANK YOU!!

Sincerely
