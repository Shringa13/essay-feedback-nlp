The author doesn't support his own idea. He lists the good of what would happen with some facts. The dangers are stacked high with exlporing Venus. With the temperture on Venus at the surface being over 800*F which in a spacesuit can still fry a person alive, and the litteral aicd rain, could malt the suit and well there goes a dead man. Even if we somehow manage to make a spacesuit that isn't going to melt or fry a person on Venus, then we can explore it. Tech these days is our down fall, we create tech thatwe use everyday, but with all the space exploration that is our go to, because we don't have the tech now to send a person from one side of the galaxy to the other. Once we do that then we can explore. Venus maybe closer to us, but there is no water present on the surface therefor no life could be living on that planet. To study Venus we would have to send someone there to collect samples, at which they have about 80% chance of death right at the moment, and a 20% chance of living. Do we want to risk someone just to explore a plant, when we haven't fully explored ours? What sence does that make? I rest my case there.
