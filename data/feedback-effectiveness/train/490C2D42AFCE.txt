Mr. senator i think we should get rid of the electoral college and change to popular votefor the presidency. I know im not even old enough to vote yet and your probably thinking what is this kid talking about but i dont think it is right to vote for the president of the united states canidate and really not even vote for him. The electoral college should vote for us because believe it or not it isnt always the right desicion sometimes. They say people of age and an american citazen that we can vote then let them vote for who they want they shouldnt have to vote really for an elector people want to feel like there vote matters. The peoples votes should go right to the box and count the votes and see who wins. The electoral college is of no need for the election process we the people can vote for ourselfs please just let us. And i know it isnt really in the writing format the way they want it i just want you to know my oppinoin and i know your probably going to just skim right over this but please if you have the time just please read over this and take the time to understand were im coming from.
