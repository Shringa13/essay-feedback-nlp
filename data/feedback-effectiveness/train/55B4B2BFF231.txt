In this passage I personally think that he did an good job with this artical. He mad sure that he included everythings that he needed to put in the artical. he inculeded that venus is earth sister and talked about NASA going to check out other planets and he evens explain the planet to.

Venus is the sister ouf the plantet earth because its to closes to earth. What i mean to the closes is Venus could possible be another earth because it has the same features and it may well once have been the most earth - like plantet in our solar system, and in terms of density and size and occasionally the closest in distance too.

Earth is closes to venus and mars but orbit the sun at different speeds means sometimes we are closer to mar and sometime venus.

The NASA has talked about idea like sending humans to study venus. They talk about what they going to bring and how far it is and what they are going to be doing. in the passage he talked about what happen in the war and how did it affect . and maybe having electronics up there too.

This passage describe venus he say that the atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blanets venus. The temperature in venus could averagr over 800 degrees fahrenheit. he dec=scrive the atnospheric pressure as 90 times greater than what we experience on earth.

In this passage I learned alot that i did not know about. I personally think he did good in this passage because he made me learn and i enjoyed reading this passage . I learn about venus and learn about NASA and what they might going to do.
