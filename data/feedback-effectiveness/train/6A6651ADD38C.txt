I have some very good reasons for why I think that you should join the Seagoing Cowboys program. There are going to be some reasons why I think you should join the program. There will also be reasons why I took the job.

What you need to know about how to be a Seagoing Cowboy.

I think that you should join the Seagoing Cowboys program. I think that you should join it because I love it, I love working with the animals; I have a feeling you would too. It is a once in a lifetime opportunity, you can't pass it up. You will also get to go sightseeing in a lot of cool, different places.

These are some reasons why I think that you should join the Seagoing Cowboys program.

Here are some reasons why I took the job; and why I think you would like it.

When I first got out of highschool, I did not think that I would be working two part-time jobs. Or be so busy all of the sudden, the jobs were so boring, it was time for a change.

Then my friend Don Reist invited me to go to Eurpoe on a cattle boat. I couldn't deny it; this was a once in a lifetime opportunity.

I think that you will love the experince with the animals and nature.

But this job can also be very dangerous, I cracked my ribs and couldn't work for a couple of weeks because I fell off a slippery ladder.

You might need a love for animals and nature, and experince with working on a farm; but you also need to be very brave and be ready for anything that comes your way.

These are plenty of reasons why I think that you should be a Seagoing Cowboy. There are also reasons why I became a Seagoing Cowboy and what you need to know to be one. Please take my advice and try out the program. I think you will love being able to see cool stuff in different countries and working with the animals. Do not forget to be ready for anything that comes your way while you are on that boat.

Your friend,

Luke
