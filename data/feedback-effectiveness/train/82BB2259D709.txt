A couple years later he was discharged,Luke had made nine trips,The most of any Seagoing Cowboy ever. The cattle boat trips were an unbelieveable experience for Luke being a small town boy. Before helping anyone he had the benefit of seeing Europe and China. But Luke also got to see the Acropolis in Greece and taking a gondola ride in Venice,Itlay.

Luke also toured at the evacuated castle in Crete and marveled at the Panama Canal on his way to China. It took two weeks to cross the Atlantic Ocean from the eastern United States and a month to China.

Caring for the animals during the crossings kept Luke busy. They had to eat and give the animals water three times a day. Bales of hay and oats had to be pulled from the lower ship. The stalls had to be cleaned.
