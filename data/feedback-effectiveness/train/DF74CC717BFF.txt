Dear Mr Sentor Of Flordia.

The land of the free, the beauty, and streets paved with gold. Thats what people think of this amazing country. The Systems we have here works even know we get insults from around that world. USA changed the world. Back a long time ago back when the application mountains was the border, this land was govered wrongly. It was a long and painful war, alot of blood was spilled, alot of tears were shed. but our for fathers founded this counrty right. Since then changes were made in our laws that helped this courty, but we should never change this goverment.

I love the Electoral collage system, i cant believe anyone would want to chage or modife it. I think this is the perfect way. With the Eletronal Collage there are never a cerntain region i nthe courty that ets left out. For explame the south and north and every other place gets the same amout. ALso there always going to be an out come for the vote. The more popular a stat has the more votes it gets, so big it cause stats to egt more people coming. Fanily There arw no run off elections thank god for that.

Thats why i believe we should keep Eletronical Collage.
