The face is a landform because the planet must of formed it a long time ago. Or some where there was life on that planet and they died right there where the surface rose up andnformed its face . Most people think it was created by aliens but it was clarified as a natural landform.

We took picture ten times more sharper than the original Viking photos. Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appered on a JPL web site,revealing a natural landform.

When they unveiled the image for all to see the caption noted a huge rock formation thee author thought it was a good way to attract attention to mars it certainly did.

But before they could see the face they had to go thorght wispy clouds and they had to wait for winter to be over. But after all that on a cloudless summer day they finally got to see the face.
