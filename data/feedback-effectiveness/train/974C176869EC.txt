Luke was offered a trip to Europe on a boat by a friend and of course he couldn't say no. So Luke took the offer but World War II was going in Europe and many countries were left in ruins. A group called UNRRA (the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration) hired "Seagoing Cowboys" to take care of the animals that were shipped over seas.

According to the text in August 1945, they received their orders to report to New Orleans. They arrived August 14 the day the Pacific war was over. Luke turned 18 the day before arriving in Greece, which meant he could be drafted for military service. He was discharged in 1947 but Luke had already made nine trips the most any Seagoing Cowbody had ever done.

Luke had a great experience doing something he loved and also helping out others. He went to Europe to have a fun vacation but ended up helping fourty-four countries that were in ruins. I would encourage a lot of people to join the Seagoing Cowboy program because you get to travel around and visit a lot of countries but also you get to help out countries that aren't at there finest at the moment. This supports why I would suggest people to join.
