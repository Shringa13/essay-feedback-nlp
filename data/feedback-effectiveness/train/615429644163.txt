Everyone should have an opinion on what they think is right. Congress should change the election by popular vote for the president of the Unites States. The Electoral College contains of the selection of the electors and there is a meeting of electors to vote for President and Vice President. The popular vote shows what citizens want, lets people have the freedom to choose who they want to be president, and have a better result.

First of all, the popular vote shows what citizens want. It tells the government what they are doing right or wrong. For example, if people say they want a democracy, that tells them that they want the right to speak for themselves. They want the freedom of speech that they deserve.

Furthermore, the opportunity to let people make a decision of who should be president for their country. For example, when people were voting for Obama or Romney, Obama had the most popular votes. That shows that the citizens trusted Obama in representing our country. They liked what his plans were going to be and trying to help us with our problems.

Lastly, it provides an accurate result of who should be president. It gives the percentage of how many people actually voted for the person that is going to be elected for president. For example, Obama had 61.7 percent of the electoral vote and 51.3 percent of popular vote. The votes show that people wanted Obama to be president instead of Romney because people like Obama's future plans.

In summation, instead of having an Electoral College, it should an election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens. Popular votes helps the government understand their citizens better. It lets them know what people want from the government, allows them to have the freedom to make a choice of the president, and gives the government a picture of how many people liked a candidate's plan for them. All in all, popular votes would make elections for the president a lot better to understand.
