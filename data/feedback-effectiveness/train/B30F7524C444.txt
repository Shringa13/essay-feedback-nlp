Dear Principle,

I think we shouldn't have our phones during school hours. I think we should be aloud to use it after school or before school, but once you enter the school there should be a policy for NO CELL PHONES. For example, what if your taking a district test or some kind of important test to get you to the next level and people are secretly texting the answers through there phone and sending it to their friends. If a teacher saw that, it would be an automatic zero and a call home from their parents. But if the teacher didn't see that, then a kid taking the test might have gotten a higher score then failing the test. For more reasons, lets say your a teacher and one of your students get a phone call during class, would you like it while he/she doesn't even bother listening to you teach, while the other kids want to learn? I THINK NOT! These are more reasons why other schools abandon having cell phone privileges. I'm not saying take away the cell phone if the student is not using it and just has it in their pocket for just incase. I'm saying if you see a student using it during school hours. Therefore my vote is to not have any cell phone privileges on campus.

Sincerely,

One of your students :)
