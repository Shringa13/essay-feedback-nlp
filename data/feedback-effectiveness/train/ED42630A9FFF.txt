One reason why you should know it was not created from aliens but is a natural landform is because they didnt have good cameras back then. An example is the first picrure they took was kind of blury and it was too far away so you couldn't really see anything. this example show that if it were clearer maybe we would have know along time ago. Another example is Moc team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the orginal Viking photo. This example shows that by cameras upgrading , we could see more closly and more clearer. My last and finale example the second picrure they took wasnt that blury but wasnt clear and was not too far but not close enough. This finale example shows how during this photo cameras where not at there best but not at there worst they were in the middle. These example show how cameras effected the photo.
