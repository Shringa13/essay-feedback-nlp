Dear state senator,

In my opinoin I think we should absolutely keep the Electoral College system. I think we should keep the way we elect our presidents because it's a non-democrac way. It's also easy and fast by killing two birds with one stone. Our founding fathers compromised the Electoral system and since we can't get rid of our admendments and change the Constitution I don't tink we should get rid of the Electoral College system. It may be old, but new things aren't always the best things. I think if the Goverment wanted to change it they should try it on a state first before they roll it to the rest of the nation, and we all know the goverment isn't that smart and won't do it because we are their test animals.

Another reason to keep the Elctoral system is because it's easy and effciant. If we just have the elction just be based off votes and not popular party it would be messy. The Electoral College System allows certainity of outcome. No run-off election because mostly likely there will be no tie. No arguing about the president being from a certain place or region so that state favors the president. Winner-takes-all system allows the people to pay close attention to the election. Swing states allow a little excitement during the election because some states like Florida you don't know which way they are going to go.Â  Big states also like Florida gets the president on the edge because the can loose every small state and still win with the big ones.

270 votes are not a lot of votes to win an elction with, but every vote counts. Some people may not vote because there are only two parties that most of the nation only cares about the Republicans and the Democrats. Some people dont like tovote in fear of their party not winning due to its unpopularity. But everyone should vote to express there politcal power. That's why we should keep it because if we change it we're changing our minds in the way vote.
