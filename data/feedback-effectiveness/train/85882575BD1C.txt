Being a Seagoing Cowboy is a very neat thing to do. I think that everyone should join the Seagoing Cowboys program because you get to travel over water. By traveling over water you can see fun things like sea animals and you can also visit cool places.

If you like animals or if you take care of animals then this is the thing for you because you get to take care of animals so that way they can get to where they are going safely. Plus if you have never done it before, it would be a pretty cool experience because you also get to feed the animals on the boat ride and you get to give them something to drink.

This would also be a fun and creative program because you get to do cool thing like watch dolphins and fish and all of the other sea creatures swim. The way that this would be a creative program is because you could make up names for the animals. In the text it says, "The cattle-boat trips were an unbelievable opportunity for a small-town boy." So in that sentence, it proves that being a seagoing cowboy was a fun experience.
