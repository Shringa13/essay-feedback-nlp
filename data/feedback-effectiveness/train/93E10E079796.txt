The author supports the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers by saying ,"Venus is Earth's twin and closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size". In the article it says that Earth, Venus, and Mars, our other planetary neighbor, orbit the sun at different speeds. Venus is the second planet closest to the sun and because of that the tempetures in Venus are way different than Earth's tempetures.

But some people or scientist actually belived theres life in venus just like earth but alot different because in the article it says," Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported varios forms of life, just like Earth. Today, Venus still has some features that are analogous to those on earth for example theres surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters. Even people think that Venus is probably our nearest option for a planetary visit just like in the article it says," The National Aeronautics (NASA) has one particular compelling idea for sending humans to study Venus". NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientist to float above the fray. Since Venus is the second closest planet to the sun the tempetures are really hot, compared to Earth's tempetures. Its so hot the tempetures in Venus are like 170 degrees Fahrenheit, but the air pressure would be close to that sea level on Earth.

But Earth and Venus are two planets that probably had same features along time ago and that we all know theres alot to discovered in our solar system and thats what i think the author was trying to support. And mybe it might happen in the near feuture and discovered more about Venus but for right now only time will tell.
