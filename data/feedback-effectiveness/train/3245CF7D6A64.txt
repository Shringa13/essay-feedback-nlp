Aliens, is this a realistic argument? On the serface of mars there is somthing impiticular. It's somthing that looks like a face. NASA decided that this would be a good way to get peoples attention. Now we are faced with the argument, could it have been aliens?

Spotted by the

Viking 1, the impiticular face does in fact closley simular to a face. the possibility of there being aleins is very unrealistic. the face could have just been another butte or mesa. The face could have just been a coincidence. But how could we know? We really can't. we, NASA, could just be saying this to get attention, but mabey not. Even if there was alein landform on mars, we will not be able to know for sure. Like any history, we only know through drawings or writing,and the only evidence we have is this face. Hopfully there will be more to find in near future. Or mabey evcen drawings will appear that we can interpit. If not, then all of NASA still has evidence that there could be .

In conclusion, Mars will probably not hold anything else like this. The picture may look like a face, but its more like mesa or butte. or will there be mystirious things like this again? Proving that it was not a coincedence. Mabey NASA will find other things on different planets, or mabey not
