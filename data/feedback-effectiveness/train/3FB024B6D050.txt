Dear principal,

I think the policy should allow us to have cell phones. There are certain reasons why. But i also think that if students get carried away using them until the fact that they use them during class that they should take them away from the people using them at that time and return them at the end of the day. I only like to be fair because I would love the chance to get to have my cell phone out. I will explain more about why i think this in the paragraphs below.

Lots of people get sick at school and need to go home. Some people stay in the restrooms and call or text their parents to come get them but the calling noises always bring attention to teachers and you usually get it took. If your sick and have no way to call your parents from the office then you should be able to call or text from where ever you are. But if it comes to a point where people are skipping class to go text then they should take that privilege away.

Almost everyone has a cell phone and love to text their friends. But when it comes to the no cell phone policy at school well trust me I understand. hours without calling or texting is like a day without happiness. You hear all these other kids calling and texting in class but don't get caught, then you try it and you get caught and your phone gets took by the teacher. You could never understand why that happens so of course you feel like your trapped without your cell phone.

The no cell phone policy is unfair in my opinion. We all love our cell phones and never want to have to put them up. This is why I am agreeing to the policy allowing cell phones in free time and not in class. No student likes to give up their cell phone. And I completely understand them.

Sincerely, STUDENT_NAME
