i would rather change to voting for most popular president in the united states and the electoral college is simply to complicated the electoral college consist of 538 electors a majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the president your states entitled allotment of electors equals the number of members in its congressional delegation: one for each member in the house of representatives plus two of your senators see all of that thats just really confusing for the new guy and me i mean why cant we simply have two groups the group with the most votes chose the president to elect simple right yah i thought so too there is also other ways such as under the 23rd admendment of the constitution the district of columbia is allocated 3 electors and treated like a state for purposes of the electoral college for this reason in the following discussion the word state also refers to the district of columbia each candidate running for president in your state has his or her own group of electors the electors are generally chosen by the candidates political party but state laws vary on how the electors are selected and what responsibilities are all of that is my goodnes its all to complicated for most people to understand here is another example the presidential election is held every four years on the tuesday after the first monday in november you help choose your states electors when you vote for president because when you vote for your candidate you are actually voting for your candidates electors most states have winner take all system that awards all electors to the winning presidential candidate however maine and nebraska each have a variation of proportional representation see thats what i mean real complicated stuff.
