To whom it may concerned:

For me, Policy 1 is better, base from my own opinion. Because Policy 1 would be better from Policy 2. For students to avoid breaking the rules of their own school, Policy 1 would be the better choice. Because they can use their phones during their break, lunch periods and whenever they have a free time. In some cases, most students and parents prefer to have the Policy 1 so that whenever they have an emergency or an important thing to do so, they can easily contact each other, except for contacting each other inside their classes.

As long as their phones are in silence or they won't be using it during their class time, Policy 1 is a good choice. And for me, Policy 1 is the best choice among all of the choices that the principle would have. For students, having Policy 1 could be nice. I think they would really appreciate it if they would be having that policy. Because if in some reason, Policy 2 would be the one that the Principle will be choosing, there's a possibility that a lot of students will make a way to break the rule just to bring their gadgets, even though they might get into trouble. But, students must know their limitations whenever they use their phones or gadgets inside the campus.

Students shouldn't be using it whenever the teacher is discussing or whenever they're inside their classrooms. Because, instead of learning a lot of things from the school, they would just waste their time using those gadgets. I hope that you understand me why I chose Policy 1 rather than the other Policy which is the second choice. Because I know how it feels like when you don't have your phone by your side and didn't noticed that something emergency from your family is happening. I wish you would be considering or approving my opinion. I choosing the right opinion so that won't have any alibis for breaking the rule of your school.

Sincerely yours,
