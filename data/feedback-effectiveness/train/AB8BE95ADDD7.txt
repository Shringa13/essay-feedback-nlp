Having the election by popular vote has benifited our community in various ways such as, Being able to compare the presidents information and how He or She will help our society and represent us, It also can allow presidents to feel as if they have a equal chance of winning votes, Having election by popular votes for the presidents can make our community's can help people get together and talk about which president is better or which on they think has more potential helping out the society

Comparing the presidents is a good way to find out who's a better and choosing that person. The electoral college is a way to get votes from people that favor the president or has different belifes and different changes in the next president. Having popular vote for president is a cool way to discover how other people want their society. Most people dont think having popular vote as president is a good idea because they wanna see what will happen or who will become president without there vote being out.

The electoral college way of voting isnt fair it dosent allow presidents to feel equal. most presidents prefer voting elections because they feel equal and want to have same rights. If most people were in positions like the president they would want to have popular vote because they wouldnt want someine that isnt better then them winning election.

I believe that popular vote has and will contine benifiting our community by equaling out our rights. Helping people get to know the presidents better, and helps the better president represent us.Â
