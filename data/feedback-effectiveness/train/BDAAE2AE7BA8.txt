In "The Challenge of exploring Venus," the author suggests that studying venus is a worthy pursuit despit the dangers it presents. He shows this numorouds times throughout this passege. One that really stood out was when he said that Venus was a lot like earth. It has mountens, vallys, hills and exetra. They said one way we could get closer and see more is if we sdend a "vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above the roiling Venusian landscape". I thought that was a smart idea becaue if the ground is to hop to stand on and be on, having something hover over it is a grat Idea.

They also said that Cenus is like our "sister plant". They say this becaus it has proven to be one of the "most Earth-like planer in out solar system". That is also a cool fact. I also read in the story that Venus is not the closest to the sun but yet it still is the hotest planet. In passage 4 it states,

"The planet (venus) has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar future". This is a intesting fact, my question to the auther would be , "Doesnt Mars have rocks and mountens? So, can mars be a sister planet to Earth as well or am I wrong?"
