The face is a natural landform because aliens are not rule. Well aliens can be rule if someone makes then and sand them off somewhere but not the point. The ponit is " the face on mars." Yes it can be created by an alien if them were rule but there not so it maens one thing the face on mars is a natural landform. NASA can be making it up to like they can go up to mars and put the "face" were it is or something can move it. NASA can do something like that but I hlop they didn't.

The face on mars could also be from someone going up tp mars and on one knowing but someone would have seen it go up. All I need to say is i think it is a natural man made landfrom or a natural landform. Bad new is no one will know wath happen or how it was made.
