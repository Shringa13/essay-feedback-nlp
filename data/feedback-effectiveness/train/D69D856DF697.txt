Dear Senator,

I honestly think this is a waste of time. I meanÂ  what the point of being a democate or a republican. Huh? We all live in the same county, so what's the point of seprating us. I would have been just fine if this article was about something else. I can careless about the government. The goverenment is very indiffernt and keeps lots of secrets from the citizens in this country.

I can sit here all day and tell you if i agree with this whole Electoral college, but it's irrelavant to me. I'm not saying that i hate this country, but there are alot of things that I disagree with. America can be very unfair. Yeah yeah, I know i don't live in the worst country ever, but I don't like this passage and I refuse the write an essay about it.

The government don't care about people who are less fortunate. Because it takes to many sacfises to help others in need. The government is indiffernt in so many ways. America works and trade and nagotiate with countries that treat their people wrong.

I may not know alot about the govornment and stuff but i still dislike this country.
