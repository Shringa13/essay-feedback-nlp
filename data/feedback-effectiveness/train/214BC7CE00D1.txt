Dear state senator,

With so many opinions on the electoral college, theres reasons in which to keep it or abolish it.

I would like a favor in keeping The Electoral College because its an election of the president by vote in congress and election of the president by a popular vote of qualified citizens."The Electoral College process consists of the selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for President and Vice President, and the counting of the electoral votes by congress(Source 1,2). Without The Electoral College everything will fail due to the fact that the college does all the voting and picking and decideing if not the Electoral College then who else will do it; All the other congessmen has to do there own job in which they cant do what The Electoral College does. The Electoral College has been in plce for a while The founding fathers created it. Its consists of 538 electors. There are disadvantages to like voters dont vote for the president, but for a slate electors, who votes for the president. At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters. But then theres advantages " The Electoral College is widely regareded as an anachronish, a non-democratic method of selecting a president that ought to be by declaring the candidate who receives the most popular votes the winner. The advocates of this position are correct in arguing that the Electoral College method is not democratic in a modern sense. it is the electors who elect the president, not the people(source 3). When you vote for a presidental candidate youre actually voting for a slate of electors. People have thier own opinions but i think it would be better to keep the the traditional going on keeping the electoral college.

Sincerly,
