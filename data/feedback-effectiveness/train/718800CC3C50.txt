The senator should keep the Electoral Collage because it keeps balance, order, and also actrecy.

It keeps balance because if the public were to vote on who is the new president of the Untied States some people might fight and argure over who's the new president, why he should be their, and a lot of other reasons. The population might think he will be a great guy and a good president, and that everything will turn out ok. Then when they are elected it turns out he might not be such a great president after all, he's probably going to make all the wrong decides and choices for this nation after a becomes president.

In the Electoral Collage they look at how many votes both of the candidates get, they also look at what the candidates have in mind for our country and all of the other plans they have enstore for it. Of course the public will have to vote on which candidate they want for this nation to serve as our president. After looking at the candidates background, what their going to do, then they will make a discision who becomes president of the Untied States.

The Electoral Collage is a good thing to have around because without it the whole voting process will be out of order. Thanks to the Electoral Collage things will stay in order and in place. And in the end we can find and get the best president for this nation.
