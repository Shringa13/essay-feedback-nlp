I think the reason why they have advantages of limiting car usage cause all these changes people who have stooped car commuting as a result of the recession may found less reason to resume the habit...that differnt thing are converging which are suggest that we are witessing a long-term cultural shirt.

another reason is that if that pattern persists they believe it will have a benfiicial implications for cabon emissions and aslo the environment and they aslo they sayed it might have a negative implicatins for the car industry. and because the cash-srapped americans could not afford new cars and the unempolyed weren't going to work either and young people decreased by 23 percent between 2001 and 2009.

my last reason is that they had demographic shifts in the drving poulation suggest that the trrends may have accelerate it the percentage had drop while older people are likey to retain there license as they age. Aslo like cellphones and car-pooling apps has facilitated more flexible commuting arrangements and they had reserachers had pondering a fundamental ques:Has America passed peak drving?
