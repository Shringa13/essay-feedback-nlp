Dear senator. One thing I like is people trying to get an education. just like me, im on my way on becoming a person who dedacates him or herself to thier job no matter what. one way to make a good education is to work hard, get plentey of sleep, and eat right! to make the day better. another way is staying in school. and you may say oh, school's boring , no fun , or just plain dumb. But did you ever figure to you that if you go to class for one day, it could reflect. How? well just think this, deciding wether or not you want to skip class or go to class, the day in class is like a year in college and a year of not going to school, could be a day in jail. so think about it, do you want to stay in class or do you want to stay in a cell, well that's your choice on wether you want to choose a good one or not. "anyway lets talk about something else shall we?" lets see what should we talk about.... OH! I know, lets talk about Electoral college. do you know what it is? electoral college is a process not a place. electoral college is the founding fathers established it in the constitution as a compromise between election of the president by a popular vote of qualified citizens. the process consists of a selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for president and vice president and the electoral votes by congress. i think that the congress is making a good dicision on keeping it this way to elect the presedent. so if you think the same good. because thats one way our socity is a step closer on becoming the perfect socity. do you think so?
