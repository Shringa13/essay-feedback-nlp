In " The Challenges of Exsploring Venus" how the author suggest that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents is by comparing venus to earth by saying " Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like earth.

What i think the author is trying to say is that Venus is very much like earth." even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's athmosphere." Why i think this is a detail that supports the claim is becouse in paragraph 3 the author list all of the negitives about Venus of how the temeture is exstreamly hot and how thick the atmosphere is and how the the clouds are filled with highly corrosive acid. despite all of these things about Venus it is still interesting exslpore and to learn about.

In conclusion our travels on earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but shoud be exspaned to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation.
