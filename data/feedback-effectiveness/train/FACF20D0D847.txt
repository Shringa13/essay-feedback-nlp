All right, to some of you people this might not sound too interesting but just hear me out. If you want a really excellent job, be a cowboy in the Seagoing Cowboy program. In fact, take it from me a cowboy who rides waves.

I became a Seagoing Cowboy when me frend invited me to go to Europe on a cattle boat. It was when World War II was going on. Some countries were left to die and had nothing. So they formed the UNRRA and hired ''Seagoing Cowboys.'' Both I and Don Signed up.

In August of 1945, they recived orders to go and report to New Orleans.''We arived August 14,'' Luke recalled ''the day the Pasific War ended.'' They got their seaman's papers and and borded the SS Charles. W. Wooster. They then headed for Greace.

Before I got to Greace he turned 18 wich ment the military could draft me .''When my draft board learned that I was on a cattle-boat trip,they tolde me to just keep doing that for my service,'' Luke says.

''The cattle boat trips were an unbeliavable opportunity for a small-town boy,'' Besides helping people, I had the side benifit of seeing Europe and China.'' but seeing the Acropolis in Greace was very speacial. So was takeing a gondola ride in Vince, Italy a city with streets of water.''

It was also hard work. I had to clean, feed, and care for the anamals. I seved as a night wathman, meaning I had to cheak on all the anamals and report to the captin every hour. One ranny night after my hourly report I slipped on a ladder and fell on my backside. I was fine but couldn't work for a couple of days because of broken ribs. I also had fun too and played vollyball games in empty holdes and more.

So in conclusion, It's splendid to be a Seagoing Cowboy because it shows you the vertue of helpping others.
