The new technology which is called Facial Action Coding System should be banned because let's see if your sad or angry, you wouldnt want other people to know how you feel instead of just telling them by your own. It sometimes can be use for just certain things and if that person gives you permission to look at the Site, then yeah it can be used to determine how they are feeling. Some people may think this new technology may be an awesome technology but some other people may also think that is just as same as other technology. For example, "If you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow. But if you frown, the next ad will be different." This means that this technology mostly works only when your smile like it said on the text. Yeah it may be awesome to other people but like i said it should be banned because there is no point on having that techology if that person tells you how they are felling. Clearly, this technology should be banned because it is not used correclty and every person who uses it is, it's using it too much and that's not how it works.
