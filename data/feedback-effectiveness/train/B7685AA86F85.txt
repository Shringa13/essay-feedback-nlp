The way I would convince someone that the Face was just a natural landform. Is that I would first tell that person that it was just shadows giving it the illusion of facal fitures. Then I would tell that person that it's the unusual shadows that make it look like a Pharaoh .Then I would tell that person that there is no scientific effidence that the Face is a alien or some sort of artifact .

And if that person still thinks that it could ever be a face and not a natural landform. I would tell that person that its a natural rock formation and is not a face . Then I would ask that person if you found a pepple that looked like a face. Would you think that humans were once the size of a pepple. Or that if you heared that chocalte milk comes from brown cows would you belive it .

And if that person had a fracture of hope still that it was a face. I would say to that person that you should not believen stuff that can't be proven . Then i would show that person the 2001 photo and ask him does that look like a face . Then i would tell that person that it's something similliar to that butte or mesa landforms around American West. And that is how I would convince that person that the Face is just a natural landform.
