If weather or not students should or should not attend class from home by online video conferencing . I think in my opinion students should do that and work from home , for example if one day you are feeling sick but you want to attend school and get all your work done that will be one method . Another example will be if you are out of town and you still need to get work your done , the perfect way will be doing it online. Lets say if I wanna study at home and do my work it will be better I will get my work done , wouldnt be distracting at all and feel much conformable in my opinion others might think it is better to go to school. I honestly feel much better doing work at home then being school, if you need help or anything just email the teacher. Another example will be getting to do all the work from doing it in bed but yet still doing your work from home should be an option or be required . In conclusion I say that students should be attending classes from home and it should be an option so they could still get there class work done.
