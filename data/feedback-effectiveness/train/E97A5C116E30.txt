Dear Principal,

Imagine you were a kid at school, and you forgot it was a shortened day. You need to call your parents but, no, you can't because your principal decided to ban cell phones all together. Now what? For this reason, I strongly support Policy 1. In case of emergencies or even to make sure of an after-school event, phones could be in great use. With Policy 2 in act, you could be staying in school for many hours until your ride picks you up.

In case of an emergency, a phone would be great to have. What if, during lunch, my friend breaks a bone or gets an asthma attack. There would be no time to call a teacher for help and even if they did come, what would they do for help? Any student's first instinct would be to take out their phone and call 911. Once your done with that, you tell your friend to call a teacher from somewhere so that they can handle the situation. "Whew," you say. "thankfully I had my cell phone."

Another reason why having a functional mobile at school would be nice to have: a ride. I forgot I had basketball practice at the gym after school and what should I do? You can simply call your ride and telling them they need to come later. What if your ride was your mom and you didn't have your phone because you didn't want any phones in your school? Well I can almost imagine what will happen next: my mom comes to pick me up, she doesn't find me, and every mom's first reaction to this mishap will be, "MY SON/DAUGHTER HAS BEEN KIDNAPPED!" This "exciting" commotion happened because you decided to go with Policy 2.

Please consider this letter because if you don't, before you know it, our school's phone bill will increase because students will be needing to use school phones to call people. With this, our budget will decrease, leaving the school left with no money for more important reasons.

Sincerely,
