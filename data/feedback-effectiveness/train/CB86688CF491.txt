Using this technology is valuable to read peoples emotions. The doctors and prof. say that the process begins when the computer constructs a 3-d computer model of the face;all 44 major muscels in the model must move like human muscles. Movement of one or more muscles is called an "action unit. Also Dr. huang observes that artists such as da vinci studied human anatomy to help them paint facial muscles precisely enough to convey specific emotions. His new computer software stores similar anatomical information as electronic code.

Dr. Huang also stated that most human communication is nonverbal,including emotional communication. Dr. Huang also gave some examples of what movments to do in front of a mirror. For example raise your lips at the corners of your mouth. second squint your eyes slightly,to produce wrinkling ("crow's-feet") at the corners of your eyes. Holding that, raise the outer parts of your cheeks up,toward your eyes.

They even indicate the difference between a genuine smile and a forced one. In the real smile, the Zygomatic major (muscles that begin at your cheek bones) lift the corners of your mouth. Meanwhile,muscles called orbicularis oculi pars palpabraeus make crow's-feet around your eyes. But in a false smile, the mouth is stretched sideways using the Zygomatic major and a different muscle, the risorius. So based on what i put down on this final draft my claim is that this kind of technology is valuable.
