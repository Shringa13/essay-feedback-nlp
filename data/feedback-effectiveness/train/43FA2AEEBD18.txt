Here at NASA the Face on Mars is known to be a natural rock formation. However some people believe that the Face was created by aliens. We are attempting to prove that it is natural.

The Face is a natural rock formation. Evidence such as a picture taken on April 8, 2001 shows that it is nothing more than a mesa which are common in that area of Mars.

The picture was taken with a camera that had a higher resolution than the camera used by the Viking 1 in 1976. The pixels in the image had a closer meter spread at 1.56 meters per pixel to the Viking 1 with 43 meters per pixel causing more of a blur effect.

Others say that the Face is an alien artifact. They say that us at NASA are covering up the fact that there is life on Mars. Another thing they say is that on April 5, 1998 when the Mars Global Surveyor took pictures of the Face the alien markings were hidden by the haze due to it being winter on Mars at the time.

The final thing to say on the matter is that the Face is a natural rock formation. The Face was not created by aliens. The pictures prove that it is natural. The fact that us at NASA say that the Face is natural doesn't mean aliens created it. Conspiracy theory disproved.
