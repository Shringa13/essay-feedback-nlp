Dear Principal:

I am writing this letter to tell you to please let us bring cell phones to school I'm telling you that because sometimes I need a phone to call my mother for an emergency, like when I got tutoring, or when the school bus left me. I think that's to strict.

I think you should let us bring cell phones to school at longest they're turned off, and letting us using them on the hallways, lunch, and at the gym. The thing that I don't like about bringing cell phones to school is that if you get caught with them they have to charge 5 dollars the first time 10 on the second time plus keeping them like for a month, 15 for the third time, and keeping them for the rest of the school year. If you don't let us bring cell phones well don't let the teachers using them in class, because if we can't bring them well that's not fair to us. Will you please let us bring cell phones if somebody gets caught three times with a cell phone please don't let them bring them again, don't charge them. If you let us bring us cell phones we tried to get more serious, and pass al most every test we take. If you will let us bring cell phones I bet these school is going to be one of the most fun schools in SCHOOL_NAME. I think the reason that you don't let us bring cell phones is because some students don't pay attention in class, and they spend the entire class period texting.

So those are all my opinions of why you should let us bring cell phones to school. And cell phones are one of the most easier, and faster ways to communicate with somebody else. So that's all I have to say.

Sincerely

STUDENT_NAME
