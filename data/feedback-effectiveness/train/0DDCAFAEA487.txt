In the article it talks about a facon mars that has appeared on Viking 1 while looking for a place to land. The face is a natral land form because thats like saying our land forms were made by aliens and thats why we have mountains, valleys, and plains. In the article it says "Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appered on a JPL web site, revealing . . . a natural land form. There was no alien monument after all.". The article also states about the face on mars"What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa--landforms common around the American West."Another quote that proves this is a land form is "Thats a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same hieght as the Face on mars."The photo of mars is a land form because it says right there in the passage it is a lava dome and it is about the same hieght as the face on mars. In paragraph 6 it says "although few scientists belived the face was an alien artifact photographing Cydonia bacame a priority fo NASA whe Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) arrived at the Red Planet in Sept1997, eighteen long years after the Viking missions ended.".
