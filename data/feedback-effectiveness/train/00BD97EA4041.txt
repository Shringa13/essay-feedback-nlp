Should computers read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom? No because, why should a computer know how your feeling? It wouldn't change the emotion the students feeling. It also wouldn't help with the students education. Its over all just a waste of time.

The process begins when the computer puts together a 3-D digital model. There are 44 major muscles in your face that the computer has to detect. Eckman classified six emotions happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness. He then " associated each with characteristic movements of facial muscles."

For example the frontalis pars lateralis muscle is above your eye which shows your surpried when it is raised.

Us humans alone can identify facial expressions on peoples faces. If you look at a friend you can tell how they are feeling at that moment. Da Vinci studied human anatomy to help paint the facial muscles percisely on the Mona Lisa painting. Dr. Huangs has new computer software it stores similar info as electronic code. He thinks there could be a different type of code to the painting.

When facial facial expressions a made its about muscular action units. The school computer shouldn't have to know how you are feeling. What kind of problem is that supposed to solve? This idea is nothing but just a distraction for school students. It also may detect wrong facial expressions.

To conclusion computers in school shouldn't detect emotions of the students. I have proved my point on why it shouldn't be in school. I have given you several examples from the passage to prove this point. It shoudn't matter if the computer knows how your feeling.
