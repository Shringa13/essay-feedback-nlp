Dear Principle

Most of the teenagers use there phones half of there life, Reconsidering the school's cell phone policy is a great idea, for many reason and some of the reasons are these. Even though you say not to bring cell phones to school students still do it , some of the students need to bring there phones to school to communicate with there parents telling them that they're at school. Other students need there phones incase of an emergency, and there parents need to contact there kids or the parents need to be contacted, the school can use there phones. It is a great idea letting the students use there phones during lunch or free periods that gives the students a feeling of trust from the school.

Not allowing students to use there phones at all is not really going to help. The students will find a way to bring there phones to school and use them while the teachers are not looking. Most of the students are already doing it, why you think putting a new policy is going to help the school it really is not, but by letting the students bring there phones in school and giving them time to use them is going to let the students know that the school trusts them, that the school doesn't think of them as children but as young and responsible adults.

To change the policy you have to look at the problem is booth ways in the mind of a teacher and in the mind of a student. Some of the teachers may think by bringing a phone to school is a sign of not having respect but it really isn't students don't mean to be rude. Sometimes there parents even ask them to bring there phones, other times the students want to bring there phones. The students in the other side feel as if the school doesn't trust them by not letting them bring there phones to school, they feel like children. All of this can be resolved if you let the students bring there phones to school and have them off and not use them, and letting them use them in there free time.

Sincerely

Your Student
