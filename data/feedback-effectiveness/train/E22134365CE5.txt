I am against that the technology doesn't have the support to make her smile because, it says "His new computer software stores similar anatomical information as electronic code" in the text.

I claim that the technology doesn't do anything with the Mona Lisa because, she is smiling in the painting because, it says " A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becomine confused or bores" in the text. While looking in a mirror, you see your own reflection of yourself because, it says "Raise your lips at the corners of your mouth bacause, technology can't do that. Then squint your eyes slightly, to produce wrinkling ("crow's-feet") at the corners of your eyes. Holding that, raise the outer parts of your cheeks up, toward your eyes" in the text.

I conclude that the technology can't support the smiles of people's faces because, there are muscles, tissues, and cartlige in the humans head. They even indicate the difference between a genuine smile and a forced one. In the real smile, the zygomatic major (muscles that begin at your cheek bones) lift the corner of your mouth. (That's our instruction #1).

Them Mona Lisa is 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry.
