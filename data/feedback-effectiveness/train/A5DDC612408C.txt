Dear principle,

I think your idea of allowing students to bring phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times, as long as the phone are turned off during class time, might be the best or possible policy because i don't think that its fare to not allow phones in school at all. I know that were' re in school and we are there to learn, but shouldn't we be able to have some kind of reward for doing school. sometimes there are student that doesn't do any work and just sit at text all day, but what about the others. I would say that if you do happened to see ANY student texting in class or on their phone period then you would probably have to take it. I also think that it's bad enough we have to wear uniforms, now we cant have phone either. If the principle did decide to not let phones into schools at all, then i really wouldn't understand why because i know that us students are tired of hearing the same thing over and over again about cell phones killing or taking over our brain sells. I think the best way for the principle to pick which policy would be to let the students vote on it and if policy one gets picked then the principle would just have to do something about the students that are using their phones in school. I can see a lot of students being sneaky and conniving by using their phones in school. So to tell the truth it really doesn't matter to me if the principle picks policy 1 or 2.

I think that students are concentrated in their phone then they on their school work. And it would be there fault when the do bad on a test or even when they loose their phone or get there phone taken. And that's all i would have to say because it wouldn't be on the principle it would be on the student.
