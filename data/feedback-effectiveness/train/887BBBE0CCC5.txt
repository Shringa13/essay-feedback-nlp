From now, human can say we are have most feeling in the world, We can be sad we can be happy, we can be angry about something we can also say'' what's a pity'' but how to show us emotion?

What's will like? For example one of most famouse art Mona Lisa, one lady always have a secret smille, she is 83 happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6percent fearful, and 2 percent angry. So amazing right? When I saw the result maybe because of that Mona lisa have beautiful of time. Complate emotion very easy to touch people's heart. this software is form University of lllinois , they hope developing better ways for humans and computers to communicate. How it work? The process begins with 3-D computer model easy to say just build a modle of the face and cumputer will calute the way muscles move and he can know the percent of your emotions, depend on each musclesthe cpmputer will know how ''happy'' you was.
