Phone & Driving Required Essay

In this essay I will be talking about if people should be able to be on their cellular device while they drive or should they not be able to? In my opinion I don't think we should be able to because there are many dumb drivers without phones in their hands and the good drivers turn worse with one in their hands. More car crashes will happen and more deaths will come with it. I just don't think putting another distraction in drivers hands would be the best option for the road.

To start off this essay I believe having any type of electronic device while you are operating a vehicle is a distraction and can cause wrecks and deaths. No type of electronic device should be in the drivers hand only type that should be allowed is the phone holders that are legal that clip onto your A/C vents but shouldn't be texting on it only phone calls and the driver should always have both hands on the steering wheel as you drive.

To conclude my essay having a phone while driving is not necessary in any way. Just wait till you park somewhere or you get home to check it, because your life is more important than a text message.
