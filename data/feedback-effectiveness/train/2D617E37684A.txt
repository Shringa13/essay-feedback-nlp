We should keep the Electoral College instead of changing it. One reason for keeping it is because the method of selecting the president may turn off potential voters for a candidate who has no hope of carrying their state. Electoral College avoids problems for example Nixon in 1968 and clinton in 1992 both had only 43 percent of popular votes,while winning a majority in the electoral college 301 and 3 70 electoral votes.

Another reason would be because some states are bigger then other and get more popular votes then others like Obama, who won the same amrgin in wymoing would net the winner only 3 electoral votes. reasons to leave it like it is are Certainty of outcome, Swing States,Big States,and to avoid Run-Off Elections. Whats wrong with the electoral vote some people seem to think its fair and more efficent.

Some people might not like the Electoral College just becaues they might think that its not fair. Some States have more electoral votes given to them then other states. Such as California t has 55 and some other states only have like 3-8 electoral votes. Some people might argue about this. It should be the more thoughtful voters that are able to vote.

Certainty of outcome can help. In the election between Obama and Romney Obama received 61.7 percent of the election while Romney had 51.3 percent of the popular votes because almost all states award electoral votes on a winner takes all basis, evem a very slight plurality in a state creates a landslide electoral-vote victory in that state.
