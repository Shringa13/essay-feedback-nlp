Dear Principal ,

I think you should change the policy, because students probably don't get an "B" just like that cause of there grades or low, and some kids play good for sports, and other kids would like to join.

First, thing I have to say about that is that some of this kids grades are low, but they be trying hard to pull up their grades but it won't wroth it cause you want let them participate because you want everybody that has an "A" or a "B" average. Another reason, why because students would look at you, and say "we tried ", and it would not be right to see other students playing.

Secondly, reason because people that you say wont participate in sports can really play good, and probably will be something in life, but they could not play cause of you.

Lastly, other people would like to join instead of the people that have that good grade. Because students don't want to be in the class rooms all day just doing work or any other thing, instead of having fun with the other kids, and talking to their friends.

Conclusion, change the policy because other people would like to join.

P.S thank you
