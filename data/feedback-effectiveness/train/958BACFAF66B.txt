"The Challenging of Exploring Venus", many scientists are wanting to exlpore Venus atmosphere. But it comes with risk and danger, possibly NASA scientists can break through that though, Venus is 'Earth's twin", yet is a challenging planet for humans to study. Why? The thick atmosphere of 97% carbon dioxide blankets Venus, with a tempature over 800 degrees Farenheit and an atmospheric pressure 90 times greater than what we could or would ever expirence here on Earth. Not to mention the erupting volcanoes, powerful earhtquakes, frequent lightning, with the hottest tempature of any other planet; traveling would be indisputable. Venus at one point was "Eath like", the planet still has familiar features such as rocky sediment, valleys, mountains, and craters.

Someway scientist have thought of some way to possibly research the mysterious planet, NASA has created a so called 'blimp' that would allow the scientists to be able to hover over Venus landscape 30 miles up. At 30 miles up, Venus would be at a 170 degrees Farenheit and pressure would be what it seems like at sea level on Earth. It is not easy conditions, but survivable for humans. Although, most forms of light can't penetrate the dense atmosphere, concerning standard forms of photography and videography ineffective or not clear. There would not be any samples of rock, gas, or anything else that would be of use. To have a thorough mission and search, you would have to get up close and personal, despite the risks, and danger. Creating a more resistant of objects that could sustain the pressure, heat and other forces. Venus is a difficult and dangerous planet to research, but perhaps one day scientists will be able to create the most effective way possible. "Imagination and Innovation, not Danger and Doubts"
