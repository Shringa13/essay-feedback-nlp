The challenge of exploring venus is so one knows what is there. Pluse no one knows anything about it soneone would have to go. Then agian it would take forver to get there and there whould be no air maybe bc its in space.

See no ones ever visited venus be it is far away and no one has done reserch on it to see if theres liveing things on there or not so someoe whould have to do that. Then someone would have to go up there maybe put a drone or rover on it drive it around and see. Then someone would have to go back up there and get the rover then look at the video to see if anythings there. Then we would have to see if theres air on this planet so maybe one day humans can live on a differnt planet.

That is why we don'go to venus yet because then we would have to built better rockets. Then we would have to get astronut food and make sure they have air helment just in case. Maybe some jet packs just in case. they get stuck and cant find a way back.
