I think that it isn't right to change the school policy because some students cant pull there grade up to a B or higher. i think that it should stay the way it is because a C is still a passing grade and its hard to focus on 2 things at once because there is always homework that you have to do or a test that you have to study for and you have to practice for a game that's coming up or you have to go to practice so that means you wont have that much time to finish your homework or study for the next test that's coming up and you cant finish your notebook for the notebook check that's coming up so its hard to focus on 2 things at once. so if you just keep it the way it is then it will be less stressful for the students and they will have less things to worry about. I think that it will be reasonable if you don't let students play sports if they have a F or a D because that isn't a passing grade so they wont have 2 things to worry about at once because they will only be focusing on school only. this is my opinion and i hope other students have the same opinion because it will be easier for most kids in this school thanks for reading this i hope you really think about it.
