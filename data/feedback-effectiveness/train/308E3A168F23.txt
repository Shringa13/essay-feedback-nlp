Dear senator i think that you shuled change to people vote then a Electoral college.

Here are the reason why you change it is unfair, stuipd. these are the reason why we should go to people vote for the president of the USA.

why does a state person can pick are next president. when the people cant choose and the state vote are more powerful then the people. the people can choose the president.

for example Nixon in 1968 and clinton in 1992 both had only a 43 percsnt purality of the popular votes,while winning a majority in the Electoral college (301 out 370). These is a reason why people right need to count more the the state.

A nother reason is it is stuiped you can have more people vote then a nother guy can get the state vote it cost more .  If you can get tmore then 200 and get litten the half you won. if you win the big state that have electoral vote you can win. you can get CAL, texas, and florida you got a lot of vote .

These are the reason why you it not faair and stupid. These are the reason why you should not letthe stae vote. You should let the peopel of the USA vote for the president then the state.
