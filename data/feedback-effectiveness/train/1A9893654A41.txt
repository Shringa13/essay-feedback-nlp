I do not believe we should use this on any students because for the fact it reads all of our emotions, which we don't always like to show now. This is one of thr reasons I wouldn't have it, "The process begins when the computer costructs a 3-D computer model of the face," to me that just sounds like something may go wrong for the fact we have the same kind of camrea for the Iphone and people have trouble with that. Another problem for his idea is, "That facial expressions for each emotion are universal," I really don't know about the meaning of this but it doesn't sound good to me either. These to me are just some of the reasons I wouldn't want this arounds school and lastly I would want them in schools because then I believe it will make schools have more bullies if someone had one and they used it. Plus they say that technology is going to take over the world, this just might be another reason for this to may be happen.
