Dear, Senator

I agree in favor yo keep the

Electoral College . Beacause the founding fathers etablished it in the

Constitution as a compromise between election of the

President by a vote in

Congress and elction of the

President by a poular of qualified citizens. We would not want to change the

Constitution that are great founding fathers had once made before. Under the 23rd

Amendment of the

Constitution of the

District of

Columbia is allocated 3electors and treated like a state for purpose of the

Electoral College.

For this reason in the word state also is refers to the

District of

Columbia . Each candidate running for

President in your state has his or her own group of electors. You help choose your states electors when you vote for I agree in favor yo keep the

Whatis wrong with the

Electoral College . Under the

Electoral College system voters vote not for the

President but for the slate of electors who in turn elect the

President . The single best arguement againt the electoral college is what we might call the disaster facter. The american people should consider themselves lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election in the century the system allows for much worse. Prehaps most worrying is the prospect of the election vote would be tied in the elctorlal vote. In that case the election would thown to the house of represenitives where state delegation vote on the president .

In conclsion this is why we should keep the Electoral college. Because they have plans for back up and everything is orginised for america. Â
