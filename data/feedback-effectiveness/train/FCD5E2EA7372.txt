I feel that driverless cars could be both a harm and a help to people. What happens if one of those cars goes under a super malfunction or some of its safety units stop working for whatever reason and there is someone or multiple people in that certain car. But, then again they could prone some serious accidents and save a lot of lives. For example, the passage stated that the car is smart enough to know its limits on what it can and can't do. It also gives off certain signals to the driver such as vibrating seats to notify the driver that the vehicle is about to back into to something and flashing lights on the windshield. It even uses a camera to see that the driver is still alert and focused on the road.

So me personally, I wouldn't use a driverless car as an everyday get around car. I'd probably use it to go around the block or make a quick grocery run.
