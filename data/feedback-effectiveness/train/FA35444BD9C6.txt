why are some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure that the students countinue learning during their break ?

first: because some schools are better then some schools in the county of virgina. the schools in the state are most likely to give out projects to keep students assure to countinue to learn during the break. student are likly to not do anything during a break because during the break student want to relax and go have fun with their girl firends and faimly members.

second: student that are smart will do the project during the break the bad students be doing sexual things and having a nice time during the break and to the students that are mostly to do the project will be disapointed on how they failed the project. student design there projects in a better way then teachers be doing because the way that teachers put there projects togeather to clarafie the way the project should be done third: why would shools require student to do a project during the break do teachers know that the black community haves like twenty persent of our students in the class room are not going to do the project to help a student during a school break is to go to the student home a give him work or notes to studdy over the break.

finily: to have a nice grade and to succsed in life is to do your work in the class room and to always be something in life and to be respectful to others and to do a project when it's do the next day for a person thats always doing a project that will make your teacher happy that you did it over the break.

counter arguement: some schools that hand out projects during a school break is not the class that i would want to be in because when the teachers put all that pesure on the student thats what makes us want do the projects when the teacher give it to us.

conclution: students are require to complete summer projects to continue learning during their break to assure that when student come back that the studnet will have a clear mind that he or she will know how to to the work that he or she gives them.
