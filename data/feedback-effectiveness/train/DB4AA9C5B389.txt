I am against using the value of technology to read students' emotional expressions. I'm not saying that this type of technology is bad though it isn't good either. I feel like this type of technology has no purpose what so ever.

In paragraph five it states that "you can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by looking at their face." If I could do that why do I need a computer to tell me that they are happy, sad and whatever else. Just by looking at the Mona Lisa painting you can tell that she is somewhat happy but also doesn't seem like she cares about being painted. Why do we need to calculate emotions to know just exactly how a person is feeling?

In conclusion we don't need this type of technology just to see what a person is feeling. It mostly feels like a waste of time at least to me.
