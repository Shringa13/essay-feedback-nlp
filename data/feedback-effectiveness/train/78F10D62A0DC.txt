In the story "The Challenge of Exploring Venus" the autheor suggest that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents by stating how Venus is earth's twin,how it's one of the brightest points of light in the sky,how NASA has one "particularly compelling" idea for sending humans to study Venus,and the different type of machines and devices NASA are coming up with to travel and explore Venus more and better.

Now i'm going to state details on the the ways I said the author supports the idea of studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. It's earth's twin and how it was much like earth before,in paragraph 4 it says venus was probable covered largely with oceans and how it could of had various forms of life like earh is today. It also says how today Venus still has features analogous to Earth,how the surface is rocky sediment and has features such as valleys,mountains,and craters. And then the author said "Venus can sometimes be the nearest option for planetary visit."

Then on how the author likes the ideas that NASA is coming up with to visit earth with what he/she said was a "compelling idea" and the machines and devices that their making that the author likes as well. They would make vehicle to float above the fray hovering 30 miles above Venus landscape,it would avoid the badly ground conditions by keeping off it. "Not easy conditions, but survivable for humans." the authoer said. All of thes details are in paragraph 5.

Then in paraagrph 7 the author said NASA is coming up with a machine made of silicon carbide to work on Venus's surface. It has been tested.

This is details to support on how the author sugguest that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite its dangers.
