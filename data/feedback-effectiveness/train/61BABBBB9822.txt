I know some people don't like to go to school and they just want to stay home and play video games or sleep. Rather than going to school, but your parents still force you to go to school. And teachers look confused and saying whats wrong with our students. And don't know what to do. And most teacher are tired of students sleeping and thinking its a waste of their time and most quit.

Professor Thomas Huang from the Beckham Institute for Advance Science at the University of Illinois and many more. Are working with this computer that can identify your emotion without showing them and they tested with famous painting the Mona Lisa and the results were incredible. And what if the teachers can use this computer software on us so they can get some feedback and fix the problem why do students don't want to come to school and I know this machine could be very useful to others schools and be useful to the cops or any force. By helping them what they are and justing getting to know a little something about the bad guy. So this could be a huge impact to everyone.
