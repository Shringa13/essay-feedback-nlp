Do voters some times get confused about the electers and vote for the wrong candidate? The single best argument against the electoral is what we might call a disaster facter. We the people should consider ourselves lucky to vote. The Electoral College is widely regarded as an anachronism, a non-democratic method of selecting a president that ought to be overruled by declaring the candidate who receives the most popular votesthe winner. If the advocates of this position is correct in arguing that the Electoral College method is not democratic in a modern sense . It is the electers who elect the president, not the people . It is entirely possible that the winner of the electoral vote will not win the national popular vote. yet this has happened very rarely when Gore had more popular votes then Bush . It can be argued that the Electoral college method of selecting the president may turn off selecting the president may turn off potential voters for a canadidate who has no hope of carrying their state . And not having everyone vote mite throw things off too. but of courseno voters  vote swings a national election, and in spite of that about one -half the eligible American population did vote in 2012 's election. It think we all think thatevery one should yote and know basic back ground on who there voting for, and avoid  run off elections. Things are not always going to go your way in life so you shold just choose wisely and wish for the best. Thank you, god bless.
