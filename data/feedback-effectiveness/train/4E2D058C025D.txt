I think the FACS (Facial Action Coding System) should be used in classrooms because it would help to see the emotions of kids. Like see if they need help or if they aren't feeling good. Mostly things like that. You could also use it to see if kids are lying or not when they get in trouble and have to go to the principle or when they get in trouble at home.

Mona Lisa: 83% happy, 9% disgusted , 6% fearful, and 3% angry! When Mona Lisa was painted in 1503 we had no clue how she was really feeling. But with the FACS it is now easy to see how she was feeling. That is a good thing because it could help us in the future with life or death situations.

When we ask questions like "Can we actually 'calculate' emotions like we calculate math problems? or "How can a simple computer recognize the subtle facial movements we humans have to use and show how we feel? shows that we humans need this type of cool technology in the future to make things easier than what they are nowadays!
