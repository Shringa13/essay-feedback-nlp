I thinck for the emotional things of the technology is kind of more advanced like every moment they do something different they always have to make a digital and some other people don't really get about the digital things they get lose really easlly and for some other people is more likely an easy thing to do but not always because it has their difficulties and they are challenging so they have to do it right or they will mess up the photo, and theirs a conclusion about this and is kind of creepy that now computer can easlly detect the movement of our facil guess what they mean like emotions and other things that's on our faces but i think it helps people to understand how things work and how our selfs are doing if their mad, sad, happy etc. there is better ways for humans and computers to communicate not only by facial recognizing, all the software of all the people are different and computers softwarre is just way different then humans it just takes time to figure this out quickly. things can actually change from good to sometimes bad and it's not the way to show their expresion that has been having by the other kind of people.
