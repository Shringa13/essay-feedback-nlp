Do you know what the challenge of Exploring Venus is? Well venus is the second planet from our sun. Venus distance but safe vantage point of Earth has very challenging place to examine more closely. They also often called Venus as the Earth's Twin. Let's see what The Challenge of Exploring Venus is all about.

First of all,

Earth, Venus , Mars are like neighbor that orbits the sun at different speeds. The differences in speed that we are closer to Mars than other times to Venus. Venus is sometimes right around the corner in space terms. Humans has numerous spacecraft to land on this cloud -draped world. Since no spacecraft survived the landing for more tha a few hours.

Secondly, The thick atmosphere is almost 97% of carbon dioxide that blankets Venus. The more challenging are the clouds of highly sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere. The planet's temps are average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit. The atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than our own planet. The conditions on Earth are far more extreme than anything humans encounter.

Thirdly,

NASA has one particularly compelling ideas to send humans to study Venus. NASA's solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus allow scientist to float above the fray. Researchers cannot take samples of rock, gas, or anything else, from a distance. Many researchers are working on innovations that allows our machines to last long enough to knowledge Venus. NASA is working on other approaches to study Venus.

In a conclusion, Do you know what the challenge of Exploring Venus is? Well, Earth, Venus , Mars are like neighbor that orbits the sun at different speeds. The thick atmosphere is almost 97% of carbon dioxide that blankets Venus. NASA has one particularly compelling ideas to send humans to study Venus. So however, I just exploring about Venus so I think I past the challenge.
