Honestly truth be told there is a valuable cause in this because alot of technology today will ask you to rate this website or did you like this song?.The computer will read only what u tell them. Although the computer cannot read how you really feel because sometimes people lie about what they do and dont like. So just because you rate that website a 7 doesnt mean you like it you might just want them to think its a good website. The computer would have to be very reliable and trusting for it to be valuable. The students these days is hard to tell because they just don't care anymore. If they don't care then there is no way to tell if they like something or not.

In the article it says "The process begins when the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face; all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles. Movement of one or more muscles is call and "action unit." In that paragraph its technically talking about how the computer will recognize facial expressions but in my opinion I feel like that would take alot of work for computer technicians to actually put more devices in a computer just to see what people think about them.

So in my opinion no I don't think they should use the technology to read emotions because it will make things more expensive and less people will buy them. Some people wouldn't like technology to read their emotions because alot of times people wont be angry at the computer they would be mad because the computer is trying to tell them how they are feeling.
