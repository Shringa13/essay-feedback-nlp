Is it a natural formed face or is it made by aliens? I'm a scientist telling you that it is a natural form rock. There are a couple reasons on why it is not made my aliens. It will be provided in the next three paragraphs.

The first reason is, that we here at NASA caught an image of a face in 1976 by viking 1. At first we thought it was an alien or a face made by aliens. Then in 2001 we found the same picture of the face, but got a better veiw and a better picture quialty of the face. The picture was ten times sharper than the first one. Whe the imaged appeared on JPL web site, reavealing that is was a natural landform, not a face made by aliens.

We did some more tests to be sure that the landform was really a landform or if it was a face made by aliens. We figured out that is was a natural landform.

That is was not an alien monument after all. We tried to find it again but it was hard.

There are no such thing as an alien. This was the reason why there no such things as aliens. We will be doing even more research, thank you.
