Dear Principal,

I am aware that you want your students to do well in school. Everyone, even if they don't admit it, wants to do good in school. I agree with your policy, and I also disagree with your policy. I agree with it because I think if the students really wanted to participate in activities, they must raise their grades. But if they really wanted to participate, they can all work hard to get their grades up. Well, I also disagree with your policy. I think if some kids really do struggle in school, they wont be able to participate in any other activities. I don't really think that is fully fair. Us students want to participate in fun activities and some really struggle. We all need time to get away from school to have fun and your not letting some students have that time. I am an average B student, and I do not participate in other activities like sports.

I really have no right to say anything, but I am supporting my friends who love sports.

I do mostly agree with you. If you really want something, you should try your hardest to aim for it. Say, you wanted to play basketball and you had a C average. If you have a C average, you cannot play. If you really really want to play basketball, try to get a B average to aim higher and higher in life. I think your policy will give us students a lesson to learn to aim for your goals and learn to know if you really want something, you must try your hardest to aim for it.
