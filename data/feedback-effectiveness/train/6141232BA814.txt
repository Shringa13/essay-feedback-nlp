In this essay I will be writing a detailed argrument convincing enough for others to join the Seagoing Cowboys progam. Soon after his high school graduation, his friend invited him to join the program. Luke thought about it and decided to sign up with his friend after he realized it was a once in a lifetime opportunity. Luke knew that it was hard work, but he learned about all hard work on his aunt Katie's farm. This all changed his life, but for the better.

Luke has gone to his first trip for Greece. While he is there he finds beautiful landmarks such as when he saw the castle in Crete and the Panama Canal. He had explored Greece, and seen the Acropolis in Greece. Luke has also taken a gondola ride in Venice,Italy. Bomberger has also had much fun on these trips where he and the cowboys played games such as baseball and volleyball when there was empty holds from where the animals were housed. They would also have boxing, reading, fencing, whittling, and table-tennis tournaments. Luke and the other cowboys got a lot more expeirence working with animals, especially barnyard animals. The "Seagoing Cowboys" sure learned a lot from these trips.

For Bomberger this has made him appreciate his life more. He has hosted many international students and exchange visitors for this reason. All of his overseas trips have taught him his value and how luck he is. The "Seagoing Cowboys" was more to him than an aventure. It was a life lesson.
