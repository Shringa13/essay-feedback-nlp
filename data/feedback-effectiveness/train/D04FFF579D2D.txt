The Venus is second planet from our sun. The Venus is the hottest surface remperature of any planet in our solar system, even though Mercury is closer to our sun. It is 800 degrees Fahrenheit.

Venus is the closest planet to earth densigy. People sent numerous spacecraft to land on his cloud draped world. No spacecraft survived that land for more than a few hours.

A long time ago Venus is cover with largely oceans and various froms of life just like Earth. Venus still has some feature that are analogous to those on Eart. The planet has a surface or rocky asediment and includes familar feature such as valleys, mountains, and craters. At thirty-plus miles about the surface, temperature would still be toasty at around 170 degree Fahrenheit, but the air pressure would be close to that of sea level on Earth.

NASA is working on other approaches to studying venus. For example, like electronic made of silicon and it been tested in chamber simulation the chaos of Venus surface and have lasted for three weaks in such conditions. They have another project to look back an old technology call mechanical computers. This devices make calculation by using gears and levers and do not require electronics at all. Modern computers are enormously powerful, flexible, and quick but tend to be more delicate when it come to exterme physical conditions. By comaprison, systems that use mecanical parts can be made more resistant to pressure, heat, and other forces.
