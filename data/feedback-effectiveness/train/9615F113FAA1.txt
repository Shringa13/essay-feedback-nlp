My principal has decided that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity. I disagree with my principal because you cant force anyone, they can do whatever they want, and some people are not best doing extracurricular activity.

Forcing someone is not good because you cant tell someone do things that they couldnt do. Some people dont like playing sports, working the yearbook, or serve on the student council.

Not everyone have the same opinion, but many people have different opinion. Forcing an students to do something probably make them feel that they have no rights.

The students should decide what they should do, not the principal because students should get their own opinions. Letting the principal decide the students what to do, make me feel not very good because it make me feel like he is telling me what to do and i dont like that.

Some other people are not good at doing sports or working the year. Some people are different from others. Some students are best other things and some are not. Many students have their own taste on something.

I disagree what is the principal is saying because they cant forcing any the student, the students should decided they own, and some people are not best doing extracurricular activity. The students should be able to choose what they ever want.
