Being in class knowing that if the lesson gets boring on the computer, it can change it into a more interesting lesson for students. This machine created by Dr. Huang and his colleague prof. Nicu Sebe can impact students in ways that are good or bad. For some people it can be a good thing but for others it can mean a bad thing.

The bad thing of this emotion recognition is that students with medical issues that affects their learning because of it affecting them from using technology. For u schools who use this technology have to focus on their students with medical problems that affects them from even using it. Also another thing that schools have to worry about is the finance for the computers that break and has to be repaired.

The good things about having this type of technology in schools is that it have more students be more interested in learning and can help them plan out what they would like to do in their future. Having the emotion recognition can help students in advanced classes who struggling with their classes have a more easier way for them to pass and graduate with the diploma they wanted. This can technology can have more students graduate and have less high school drop-outs.

The emotion recognition can be a good thing for certain students and can be a valuable thing, but for other students it can affect they way they learn if they are more hands on or have a medical problem that makes them unable to use technolgy. Even though this machine created by Dr. Huang and prof. Nicu Sebe is a great thing for schools but it can have different impacts on students wether it's good or bad.
