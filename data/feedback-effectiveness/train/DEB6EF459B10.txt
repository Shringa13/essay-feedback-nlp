Dear principle,

It would be fare to other kids if you put " you cant play any sports unless you have a B average or more". so many kids probably couldn't play their favorite sports and their parents would get mad enough to have them switch schools. lets put it this way, if you say they can have a C average in their grade the school would be a lot better place and wouldn't be as boring as it is. you could have a really good athlete who does every sport and is a super good running back for the team, real fast and every thing. what happens if he dropped from a

B average to a C average? that's what i am talking about. you can just at least say you have 2 weeks to get up your grades and if you don't then to bad so sad. if you're school is having a big dodge ball tournament after school and you have teams you play with and you have a C average then its really boring for you and your dodge ball team is one man short and they cant play because of you.

all the student would want to change that other than the really smart students who have A averages, but that isn't the case here. its just wouldn't be fair to all the other student who liked sports in that school. so can we just see how it goes.

sincerely, STUDENT_NAME
