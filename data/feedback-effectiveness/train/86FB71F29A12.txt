Dear principal.

i think we should help the community by cleaning not by tutoring because that just helps the students. not other people of the community. we need to help everyone.

not just students. maybe we could do both that way it would help students and the community. i hope you agree with me. i would help with both. so that i could do my part. if you don't agree with me. you could tell me and i will think of something else. or we could talk it through. and find a suggestion that we both agree with. i just want to help everyone in the community. so that everyone will be happy and clean up and tutor. and when someone is not doing one thing they could do the other.

maybe it would help other people as well. i mean we want everyone happy don't we.

because we all care for the people of the community. to me the community is important to everyone. because if we don't have everyone happy we can't help the people of the school. i know this is not to your control. but i was hoping that everyone could be happy. but both does sound alot. if we can't do both we can at least do one that will benefit everyone. i know i am just a student but we can make a big difference in the community. we could probably make it better. you decide which one is better. and hopefully let me know. i hope i don't sound to pushy or anything. i am just trying to help. i know my ideas are stupid. but if you like them or you don't i will understand.
