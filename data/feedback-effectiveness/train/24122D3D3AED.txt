principle ????,

I think that the newly proposed rule may have advantages and disadvantages.

It will ensure that only those who are willing to do the work and try hard will appear on the sports teams and academic groups, bettering the program. Yet I also feel that this pushes the boundaries of the 'no pass no play' rule very far. I think that students should have a choice in this yet I can't help thinking that this would help solve problems, so i am forced to vote for this new rule. those who aren't willing to do the work in order to compete obviously don't care much or they would aim for that higher grade and try harder. This will teach them a valuable lesson in life. Think, what would happen in your life as an adult if your boss told you that he needed you to do something he needed done. Many would say yes in order to please their boss. those who are not willing to work hard to do what even extra activities would probably not be willing to put out the effort for a job. what happens then? You are fired! This would show them to put more effort in order to succeed. the newly proposed rule is a wonderful idea, and will eventually provide the educational system with a higher amount of success in individual schools.

In conclusion, i believe this could be a quite useful rule and cast my vote for the rule of no students participating in extra activities without an average of 79 or above.

Sincerely,
