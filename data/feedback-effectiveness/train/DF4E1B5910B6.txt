They say Venus can sometimes be our nearest option for planetary visit. Its a crucial consideration given the long time frames of spave travel. The value of returnung to Venus seems indisputable, but what are the options for making such a mission both safe and scientifically productive.

I think if we can study Venus up close we'll get a better understanding of the planet, like what materials it has and how the weather conditions are. NASA has a compelling idea for sending humans to study Venus. NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray. A blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above the rolling Venusian landscape. However, peering at Venus from a ship orbiting or hovering safely far above the planet can provide only limited insight on ground.

To meet the challenge presented by Venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors. Our travels should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation.
