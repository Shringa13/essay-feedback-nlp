The use of this technology in a classroom would be useful because it can help teachers identify how a student is feeling, if the are confused, and if the need help. For example," a classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored," Dr. huang predicts. " Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instrucuture." This is really helpful to some students because when taking an online lesson some of them might be comfused and the teacher is no there to help. So the computer can take these facial expresions and modify the lesson so you could undestand it better. This also follows along if a student needs help with the lesson, the computer could see you are having a hard time and t to help you by changing the lesson.

Also it could help teachers identify emotions by the facial expresion. "You can tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face. Of course most of us would have trouble actually describing each facial trait."

If the student is acting up the teacher can use this new technology to see if the student is sad or angry. Then she can ask the student if everthing is okay or if he needs to talk to someone.

In conclusion the new technology would be usful in a classroom because it can help teachers identify how a student if feeling, if they are confused, and if they need help.
