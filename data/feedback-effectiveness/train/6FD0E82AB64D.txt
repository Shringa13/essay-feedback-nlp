While the idea of a computer being able to reconize the emotions of sudents in the classroom is an intresting one, it simply wouldn't work well enough when put into action.

When it tells of how it could modify the lesson when it recognizes a student becoming bored sounds reasonable, when you think about it, having a computer changing a lesson simply due to possibly a single student becoming bored with it, would not only make the lesson longer, but maybe even worse off than it might've been.

There is also te question of what if the computer gets something wrong or has a glitch? what if it accedentily misinterpruts sadness as anger for example. Not only will this cause a plethera of complications, it may also lead to the computer making other mistakes in the process.

While it is an intresting idea, it really needs to be utterly perfect in every way or else it could cause many problems.
