Hi my name is Generic_Name and i am going to tell you why people ask you for advice and then ask multiple people for advice. Some people ask for more than one advice to see maybe if they look good. Also they my need more than one person advice for clothes just to see if it is good or not. Also you know when you go to a store you ask some one if this glasses look good on me and then you ask some one elas for advice.

However some times asking multiple people for advice may not good. This may not be good some times because if you ask a friend if you should do something you may not hear what you what and then you ask your other friend for advice and they say the same thing. Also this may be bad because the advice people give you may not be positive a may be negative. And this could bring you down.

However the advice other people give you may be positive and make you happy .And this could also help because the more people that give you positive advice the more you will fell good about your self. And the more positive you are the more you will give positive advice.

In conclude that if you ask multiple people for advice it could be good and it could be bad but it is still good to ask for mutiple advice.
