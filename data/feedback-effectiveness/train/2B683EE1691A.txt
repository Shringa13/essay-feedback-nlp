Students bring cell phones to school for either 2 reasons, 1 is for texting in class, and 2 is so incase something happens they can call there parents. I think it is ok for kids to bring there phones to school but if they are texting someone or playing with it in class you should take it right away because they aren't even aloud to play with it or text on it in class.

when they say to turn off your phones in class the students really don't turn them off they either hide it from you when it makes a sound, or they turn it on silent or on vibrate so when they get a text no one can hear it or if someone calls them.

My opinion is to allow students to bring there cell phones to school and to turn them off when in class but they should be allowed to use them if they need to, but would have to ask the teacher and they can only be calling their parents or any other close family members, or their guardian.

If they are not calling their close family members or parents then take the phone away and call their parents and tell them about it and tell the student to com get it from the office after school is over.

The reason I want to be able to have phones at school is so that we can have a way to call are parents with are phone because there might be something wrong. But If we call from the school then are parents might not answer because they might not know it is the school or they just don't want to talk to the school right now. This is why we need phones at school.
