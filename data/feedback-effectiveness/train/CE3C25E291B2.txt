"Its a good thing for computers to be able to tell human emotion?" Well Dr. Huang thinks it is a good idea. Now I dont know if it is just me but with all the robots taking over the world thing in movies but i dont think it is such a good idea. Dr. Huang has came up with a computer that can read human emotion's.

Now Dr. Huang's computer syestem can tell six human emotion's and let me tell u somthing human's only have six emotion's those emotions are (happiness, surprised, angery, disgusted, fear, and sadness). the computer can recognize the subtle facial movments we human's have to express hoe we feel.

Computers use this thing called CALCUATE EMOTION'S it those are your thinking part of your emotions like as simpole as solving a math problem and doing your work or thinking ahead.

so how i feel about this hole thong is that is a bad idea and that we should not have even come up with it but that is just me.

p. s. dont say I told you so when the hole computer taking over the world is happening dont say I didn't worn you!
