In the article "Making Mona Lisa Smile" By Nick D'Alto the author describes how a new technology called the Facial Action Coding System enables computers to identify humans emotions. This technology is very valuable for the classroom. The statment is true because as said in the article the computers will be able to read ther emotions and adaped them selfs to make it seem more intertaning. This technology would play a mager roll in learning. the text states in paragraph 6 that "a classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored"," Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor",that help for students and teatchers would be amazing. Plus what would it hurt ? its not a painless unnoticable process that helps the students get a better education. With this in our cumputers it can read the emotions of students better then the teacher ever could and can get the learns more focused and smarter. This technology will help out students more then ever and is to valuable to pass up and should be in every classroom posible
