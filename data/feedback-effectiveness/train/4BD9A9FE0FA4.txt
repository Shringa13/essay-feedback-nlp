I think you should let us students that have a

D

should play sports. I think you not let kids with a F

should not play because then need to have higher than a F in the grade book . She should just let some students play sports.

I think we should have more activities so everyone would come to school everyday i don't know u might have a lot of new students if some things change . Everyone might listen or they will not listen at all we might get sent to the principals office.

You the principal should think about this we should have more students play sports. and also have free time . But if we have torturing we should have it for students that want help and that . Like if we had a activity to go on a fill trip we should go to one .

Because we never went to one since last year when we were in 7th grade.
