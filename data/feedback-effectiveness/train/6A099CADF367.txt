Dear Senator,

After doing some background research on the theme of the electoral college, i have realized that this system is wrong and should be changed. Now you msy aks yourself why?. Here are my reasons on why to exterminate the electoral college. And my ideas on what is going to replace it.

What the electoral college does is basically a chain of votes. Meaning someone votes for someone and then that someone votes for another someone. This may seem confusing, and personally i think it is!. Why vote for a slate of electors when we could vote for the president. I mena is like skipping a step of the sequence(a very complex sequence)

dont you think its easier, faster, better and less confusing to just vote for the president. Every single citizen votes for who they want. thats why i propose an idea. this idea is easier, faster and better...

Mr/Ms Senator lets apply the election by popular vote system. its less confusing and less biased. For ex. if u want to vote for "Tim Hart"for president, you just have to vote simple right; now using the other system you have to vote for the group of democtratic people that is voting for Tim Hart. And then hope that they didnt steal your vote, and they voted for another candidate. You see what im saying her. The system of popular election vote is way safer than the electoral college.

Also this system is more equal than the other, speaking of the problem of small states. Ex "large states gets more attention form presidential candidates than a small state does"(4 big states, P 21 L 10). This shows that the electoral college system is unequal. Now in the other hand with our system , no matter small or large states, everyone will get the same attencion.

To conclude this essay the election by popular vote is clearly safer, faster, better and more equal than the electoral college, this is why i ask you if you could just think about the idea, and share the word with your collics and people you know

Thanks
