I think we should keep the electoral vote. My reasonings are: certainty of outcome, everybody agrees with him/her, swing states, big states,and avoiding run-off elections.

There is a certainty of the outcome if we keep the electoral voting system. It will be more accurate than using the most popular vote. If the election of 2012 would have been accounted to popular votes than Barack Obama would have lost the election.

We want to have a president that believes in what we believe in. We also want a president that appeals to everyone not just one region of the United States. We want to have a president that gets things done like Obama has because we are in a lot of debt.

Swing states have a big impact on whether he/she is in office or not. They are more likely to pay a attention to their campaign than other states. They have more of an impact to whether they win the election or not.

We need big states to help win the elections. Without them the presidents wouldn't get as much electoral votes from bigger states than from the smaller states. You need more electoral votes then the opponent to win the election not just popular votes.

With the electoral college we would avoid run-off elections. Run-off elections are when nobody gets the mojority of the votes. With the electoral college we would be giving the presidency to the candidate who has the most electoral votes not the most popular.

So in conclusion if you have more popular votes that doesnt mean anything. If you have more electoral votes you will win the election.
