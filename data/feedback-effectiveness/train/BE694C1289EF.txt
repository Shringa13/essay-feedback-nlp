Dear principle,

Some of my friends think that community service is a great idea, but some of them think it takes up way to much time for them. I think that community service is a great way to keep our planet clean. I think I will join the rest of the elementary schools and tell them the three r rules, which are Reduce, Reuse, and Recycle. I can't believe people don't just use this rule. Some people throw there trash on the streets then we have to pick it up. I think its not fair for the rest of us that we have to pick up other peoples trash. Sometimes i think some people are disgusting at the way we treat this world. We should treat it like its our nice house. I also think that people could use the three R' s. If we don't keep up on the community service our family which is the world will fall apart because of the litter. I care for this planet and I hope there's other people out there that care to about this giant family (world). I also hope that you do the same thing that we are doing as well. For the other people that don't care at least try and help this world. I am begging you to try... Please don't let this world fall apart.
