Is something wrong with cell phones being allowed in school? There is no such accunization. Cell phones are used for important purposes and should be allowed in school and usable except in class. That's why i chose to go along with policy one.

Policy one states that cell phones will be allowed in school and that students could use them during lunch and other free periods. However in class, they are to be silenced and put away! There are many reasons for this policy. It also helps the kids not get in trouble as much. Students mostly get in trouble for texting in class.

This policy is trying to prevent students from sharing test answers in class. If they text in class they could be texting their friends telling them the answers and that is called cheating. Cheating is really a wrong thing to do, it shows what you know not your friend. Major consequences are handed out to cheaters that can cause them to fail or suffer in their career choices. Therefore cheating is prohibited.

Another thing that is being prevented is the lack of knowledge. Students think they can text and listen simultaneously. But truth is all the information is going in one ear and out the other. It is important because it can help you in life. Grades reach higher levels than texting in my opinion.

The students shouldn't have a problem because, it gives them the opportunity to use it during the daytime. It's not like a prison where they have no cell phone. Students should be very grateful and lucky. They have many breaks to use them just not when it is time to be focused. Hopefully, this will help kids in the future.
