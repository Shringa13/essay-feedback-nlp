This new technology is very useful to find peoples emotions or even to what they're thinking about. But also it can be very bad to read other peoples emotions because it can become very personal. I say this because what if a kid is having a bad day in the class room and you read their emotions or even thoughts, it can be very rude. An example would be what if some kid was aving some hard times at home before they went to school and they're thinking about what happened the night before they went to school or what will happen to them when they go home from school. But this new technology can be very helpful because what if that student is struggling in their classes and they're too shy to say anything or to get any help. It can be very stressful and may lead to the student to want to just shut down and shut anyone out. But if you had this tachnology in the classroom it can help the student, becausse then the teacher will know that there is something wrong and try to help the student out with his or her problems in a different way like in tuduring only that select student. Or the teacher could go up to the student and figure out what's wrong and persude the student to be more open and talk about what all is wrong. But like I had said it can be very helpful or very harmful in ways.
