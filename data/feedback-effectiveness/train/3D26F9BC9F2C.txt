Luke didn't paticipate in the Seagoing Cowboys because he hat to stay at home. And because he had just graduated from high school. he didn't think it was nessisary to go and he had a leave at home even tho he had a family at home. He didn't want to just leave them at home with out him. Becuase he had no one to watch them when they was at home alone with no one to talk to. He desided to stay and not go so he can be there with them and he was going to pertect them from harmes way. he loved his family to much to just leaver to join a cowboy group with people her didn't know at all so he said No and that he was staying with them. Because if he would have left it would proboly change ther life and his forever. they didn't want to stay home by there self for a long time he wanted to stay and help them out around there house and other stuff. And because it was to danges for him any way that is why he didn't want to go. And he just wanted to stay and not put himself in danger because it was a war and he didn't want to die and never return.
