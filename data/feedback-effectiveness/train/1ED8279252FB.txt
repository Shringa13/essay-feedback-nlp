Im writing to say that I think we should keep the Electoral College. i think its fair and that everyone should be used to it by now because we have been doing it for a long time. Everyone knows that when you are voting for your candidate you are actully vintg for your candidate's electors. Even though people think the "Winner-take-all" system is not fair i think it keeps everything in line. There are reasons why this system was created to prevent major problems from happening.

I think that it does not matter if Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole, and the AFL-CIO all want to Abolish the electoral college. Sure over 60 percent of votes would prefer a direct electionto the type of elction that we have now  but I think it will just cause problmes. We would have to make new rules to when it comes to voting which could take a long time because we would have to have he approval of many people. Then everyone would have to learn these rules and the age to vote could be possibly changed. For everone to get used to these rules could cause many fights and arguements between peopl. The chances of a cadidat of winning could change alot.

Popular vote can increase the chances of there being a tie, causing a disater. Everyone should trust the electors. It is possible that the winner of the elctoral vote will not win th national popularf vote. even though that has happened rarely. Although it did happen once in the year 2000, when Gore had more popular votes than Bush yet fewer electoral votes, but that was since 1888. With popular vote it is not certain what can happen.

For example the electione of 2012 Obama received 61.7 percent of the electoral vote compared to only 51.3 percent of the popular votes cast for him and Romney. Therefore  the electoral votes should not be abolished, popular votes will only cause problems.
