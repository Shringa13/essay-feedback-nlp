Dear Principal

I think we should be aloud to use cell phones during free periods. Technology is part of the future and we will use it when we are older. It will help us become adults. We can also keep up with our friends and our parents can call to tell us if there is a problem. Kids already use them.

But the cell phones should be shut off during class to stop distractions. We all need to face it we will all be using technology in the future. Most of our jobs will require a computer or cell phone. Why not let us express our freedom. If you tell them they cant use there cell phones they will want to use them and if you tell them they can they will think your cool and wont argue with you as much.

Another reason cell phones should be shut off during class is because the kids could text each other the answers. Let us express our freedom. If teachers can use them let us so we our all equal, and we don't look down on each other. I agree There has to be rules but we also should be aloud freedom. If we couldn't have phones at school how are we supposed to call our parents to come and pick us up. Or if school gets canceled how are we supposed to call them.
