I think that having this new technology in the classrooms would be a good thing. Many people may not agree with me but new can be good. Also many kids may think that its a bad idea but trying different things in the classroom could help many kids out. And the teachers would love that. But even if its not good the teacher wouldn't have to keep using it. In the artcle the author says, "Hold on! Can we actually "calcuate" emotions - like math homework? And how can a computer recognize the subtle facial movements we humans use to espress how we feel?" (D'Alto 2). Here the author makes a good point. Could this really would? How is it possible? Is it helpful? And there are many more quetions that I'm sure people have about it. But trying something new and seeing if technology like this could really be valuable is wroth trying out. Also this would be a good thing becasue kids would learn about art. The Mona Lisa is very famous and many people know about it. And learning more about it would be great thing for the kids in the classroom. I can see why many people wouldn't like it in thier classroom though. Maybe the teacher doesn't like art. Or maybe they don't know that much about art. But even if that's the reason for not trying this out I believe it would be good for the kids and they would learn something new and different. And that can be very imporant in the classroom and for the childen. At the end of the artile the author stats, "By the way, did making a happy face in the experiment also mkae you feel slightly happy?" (D'Alto 9). Using this technology can not only help the kids learn about the art behide it but could also help them learn more about themseleves. And to me and I'm sure to many teachers that is the most imporant thing of all.
