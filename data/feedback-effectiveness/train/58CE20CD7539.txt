Dear Principal,

I have heard that many students are arguing on whether community service should be done by the students and i just wanted to share my opinions with you to help your decision.

Community service, i believe, is a great way to help people who need assistants and it helps us become better people. There are many things us as students can do such as: reading to the elderly, babysitting, and picking up litter from the parks or streets but also children like to have time to do fun things.

Children always want to have fun by playing with toys, going to a boiling alley, or going to see a movie but life in my eyes has to have a little responsibility and in what better way than to help other people in community service.

I, as a student, have always done community service because it makes me feel like i have accomplished something important and because i have helped my community in someway while also having fun. So my conclusion to you would be that children should be requested to do community service but not so many hours were it takes the away the fun in life.

Yours truly,
