The use of technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable. The reason for this is that you can tell weather the person is really smiling or not. The computer software FACS (Facial Action Coding System) can classify 6 basic emotions like happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness.

The passage states that the computer contructs a 3-D computer model of the face;all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles. Movement of one or more muscles is called an 'action unit. The passage also states that using video imagery, the new emotion-recongnintion software tracks these facial movments-in a real face or in the painted face of Monia Lisa. It can even identify mixed emotions. Each exspression is compared against a neutral face. The computer can tell weather you are happy or sad. Like in the passage it says that for an example, if you smile when a web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow. But if you frown, the next ad will be different. A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored, then it can modify the lesson like an effective human instructor.

The evidence from this passage shows that the use of this technology to read the emotional exspressions of students in a classroom is very helpful. like stated in the claim and passage "A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored, then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."
