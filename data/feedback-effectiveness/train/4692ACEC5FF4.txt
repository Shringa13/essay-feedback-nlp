my name is STUDENT_NAME

and i think that policy 1 is a good idea because at lunch kids are always up to something at lease this way kids are not in trouble for doing something stupid because they would be in there phone texting and things like that there would not be as many fights they would be in the phone. and wouldn't care who's around just what there phone is doing and it would get there minds off the nasty school food it would keep the students busy the teachers wouldn't have to listen to kids scream as much. the teachers get to play with there phones all day why cant we play with ours at lunch. the only bad thing is it would be hard to get them to put the phones up and if they don't then u take theme up then they would learn to put there phones up when told but that is what i think it is up to you to choose what we do
