Cars can be great or bad, many places are banning days of driving to slow down the inevitable of car fumes in the enviroment. Advantages include a healthier way of life. Walking makes you healthier, and so will the cleaner air. Creating less polution in areas in good for the enviroment.

The ban on cars can seem a little crazy. But picture how much healthier people would be if they didnt relie on their car to get some where. Now, even though there are large cities that are spread out, like Jacksonville, it seems almost insane to give up cars. People would be more forced to leave their house to go to work, school, ect.  But just picture how great it would be to save the enviroment and alos getting a good healthy workout to and from where ever, it doesnt always have to be walking, bikes are what people use as well.

Global warming is real, and it is slowly happening. And cars are major factors for the cause. Some citires are taking action to this by banning driving in some way shape or form. This actually helps bring down smog. Paris saw the difference in only a few days!

Less polution is happemning because of the new bans of cars in some places. And people are loving it! A more healthier lifestyle is now being used. Less polutiion more healthier for you and for Earth. It wont let me leave this page, im confused.
