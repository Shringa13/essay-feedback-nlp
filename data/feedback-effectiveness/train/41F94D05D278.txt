The Electoral College is a process which the founding fatehrs established as a compromise between election by a vote in congress and by popular vote. The Electoral College con sists of 538 electors. 270 electoral votes is required to elect the president. This is a way of how the votes are calculated in the United States.

I want to change the way that this voting is held. It is not fair for the electors to elect the president. Because of the winner-take-all system in each state, canidates dont spend time in states they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the swing states. It should be on the peoples votes since they are the ones being affected by the changes. Not by the Electoral College.

The winner-take-all system is not fair what so ever. If there are more votes foe whatever president in that state then the electors will go for that president. This is like bandwagoning for football teams. If they go to the national championship they will change to that team. This voting shopuld change to the peoples votes instead of this winner-take-all system. It is more fair and balanced.

Think of it this way in 2012 that more people voted for Mitt Romney but the electors didnt think so that is unfair. Right? The voting needs to be changed once and for all to a popular vote system instead of the Electoral College. This is the best way for the United States to deal with this madness. One solution and you are one step forward to a better Nation.

The Electoral College may have been in better use for the past but now it is the future and we need better ways for voting. We need to go back and use popular vote instead of Electoral College.
