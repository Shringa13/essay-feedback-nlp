The author of The Challenge of Exploring Venus suggested to study venus is a worthy pursuit despite it condtions and or dangerous risks. I think the author thinks studying Venus is worthy based of the author saying in Paragragh five althought it is 170° F(Fahrenheit) it may be difficultt condtions, but it still survivable for humans.

More evidence of it being worthy of studying is in Paragragh seven saying NASA is working on other approaches to studying Venus. From one of there examples, some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venuss surface and have lasted for three weeks in such conditions, meaning it is possible to find research. Research is our only way of getting data proven in Paragragh six stating "researchers cannot take samples of rock, gas, or anything else, from a distance. Therefore, scientists seeking to conduct a thorough mission to understand Venus would need to get up close and personal despite the risks".

And my final piece of evidance stating it is worthy of studying Venus is in Paragragh's six and eight "peering at Venus from a ship orbiting or hovering safely far above the planet can provide only limited insight on ground conditions because most forms of light cannot penetrate the dense atmosphere, rendering standard forms of photography and videography ineffective. Striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors. Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation."
