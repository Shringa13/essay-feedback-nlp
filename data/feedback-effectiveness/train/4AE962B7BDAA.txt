I don't think that this is valuable for students in a classroom just to read their emotions. It invades their privacy on if they want to share whats going on in their life or not. The students can share if they want to but they should't have their emotions identify by a computer and have their teacher to see what results came in for their emotions. In the article it states that "we humans perform this same impressive "calculations" everyday" when actually you just sense it or study their face to see which emotion you can see through their eyes or facial expressions. We don't need a computer to detect our emotions when we could say how were feeling and not have a computer tell for us. In the article it states that "Eckman has classified six basic emotions-happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness-and then associated each with characteristic movements of the facial muscles." I pretty much don't beileve a computer can detect emtions from our faces when we could use a computer for many other things instead of emotions. What about our other emotions? gulity? curious? love? etc. How exactly can a computer detect our emotions? When a real human can detect it by the look of our face and talking about it. Yea it might have some good sides to it for crimes and all that but please this is not for our students just for their teachers to read their emotions and invading their privacy.
