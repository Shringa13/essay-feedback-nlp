I would pick policy 1 because lunch is free time to eat talk to your friends and to use the restroom. If u need to tell your mom something you can text her or call her but when your in class and u want to text someone you will miss the work and you won't know how to do the activity because your texting. When you have free time that's when you can text call but not in class because if you do then we won't know how to do the work and we would get a bad grade.

So when it's after school lunch or your free time you can use a phone but when your in class you need to turn it off because your teacher is trying to teach you something. When your in class every day you know something new about something, someone, somewhere. So when your in class no phones when your out of class you can text make a phone call take pictures of friends. Who wants to pass i know i do because i want to get a good job because if you don. t pass your classes then you can't get a good job.
