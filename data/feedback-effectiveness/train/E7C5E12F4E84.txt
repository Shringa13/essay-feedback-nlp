I am against technology being able to read students emotional expressions. We shouldn´t have computers telling exacly how our students are feeling. Some things are personal and some kids might not want other kids to know if there feeling sad, mad, or happy. In paragraph one it tells the percentages on Mona Lisa, that going way to far with personal space and thought. Some things are meant to be un said and if a teacher asks you in class how you felt about that certain situation they can tell if your lying or not, and that´s your choice if you want to express that.

Students could be bullied if other kids didn´t like there opinion about something. Even if something made a kid feel happy that something bad happened to another student like personal thoughts , that could be blown out of context. Even though you may not have the brightest look on your face doesn´t mean your not happy, like thousand of kids walk around school with bleh looks and they may actually be happy but just showing that expression, but the computer would read it as sad or mad. Computers are already taking over a lot of things, but when it comes to humans we should´t need a computer to tell us how were feeling. Computers and technology aren´t 100% right, only you would know exactly how your feeling.

In conclusion computers shouldn´t be allowed to read students expression. In paragraph 5 Dr. Huang says it isn´t hard to tell whether a friend is feeling happy or sad you should be able to read that, so why exactly do we need a computer doing that? Some things us humans should be able to figure out because its our body and we know how it works. Therefore we shouldn´t need technology going pass our personal boundaries and telling us how we feel . It would just cause more conflict and more wasted money on things we ca just figure out ourselves.
