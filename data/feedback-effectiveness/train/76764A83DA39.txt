Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I do not believe it is right that you should change the grade average to participate in sports. There are many reasons and even benefits to keeping the grade average the same. Such as ability, responsibility, and many other reasons that will be discussed in this letter.

The first and for most reason would be because of academic ability. I do not think that athletes should be punished for not being able to achieve what is considered by some academic greatness. To maintain a b average is hard when you have practise, chores, and many other things to do. Not to mention the fact you have been at school all day.

My next option is that kids should be able to do what they want after school is over. If we have to spend eight hours a day five days a week here on top of homework ,chores ,and whatever else comes up we should not be made to have a b average to do something we love and want to do.

My next point is we should have to have the responsibility to hold ourselves accountable for our grades we shouldn't be held to that by other people and their threats. We should be the ones to care for our grade ,and if it gets too low we should take responsibility and take ourselves out of sports.

Thank you for taking the time to read my letter.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
