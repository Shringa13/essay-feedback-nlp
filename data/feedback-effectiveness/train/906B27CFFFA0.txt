Do you agree with the princable about. Evrey student must particapait in at least one of these three things. Number one they must paly a school sport,They can be a yearbook desiner,or a school counclier. Well I am going to go in more depth and explaine the jobs to you.

I am going to exblaine each job that the princable requires us to do. The first one is sports such as baseball,softball,basketball,track but thoses sports could be hard for some people that have. Autisum they are not capable to run,or just a mintale illness. so I am going to have to dissagree with the sports because not all the members of the school can do it.

Second thing is they could take place in a yearbook club to rplace a related art or a sport! I am going to explaine what a yearbook club dose So a yearbook club has many things to do the main thing is they can go in anddesine our school year book! There job can get hard because they take there time and effort to make our yearbokk look perfect! All in all I feel like everyone could do this club beacuse it dose not take that much effort and time or running or athtisume.

Last but not least school conciol. The school counciol does a lot of things here are a few. They can help around the school such as help people work threw there problems. They can go to gideness more and help with them. Oh and this is a big one when the 5th graders come over to tour the middle school. There incharge beacuase there the school councle. All in all i think this would be a fun job that everyone could particpate in.

OK so let me ask you gain to you agree or dissagree after all those statments? I am going to have to agree because of the last two I really feel like a lot of people could do that plus it would be fun for all the people with disablitys to learn and get closer with students do you??
