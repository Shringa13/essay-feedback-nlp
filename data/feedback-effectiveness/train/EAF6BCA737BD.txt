In the article "The Challenge od Exploring Venus," the author states that NASA has a compelling idea to send humans to Venus to study it." Their solution to surving the harsh environment would be to float above the fray. Avoiding the unfriendly ground conditions by staying up and out of thier way.

In paragraph 6 it states that," Researchers cannot take sample of rock,gas or anything else, from a distance. Therefore, scientist seeking to conduct a thorough mission to uderstand Venus would need to get up close and personal despite therisks." Meeaning that if they want to be able to study Venus from the ground they would have to build something to allow them to safetly gather samples and information first hand.

In paragraph 7 the author mentions that looking back to world war ll they could use mechanical computers instead of using eletcronic ones. The mechanical computers could be made to widthstand the damage of acid,heat and pressure. To test the mechanical computers they can put it through the series of test that they can create in the test chambers to see if they can widthstand it.

In conclusion if we wanted to get a closer look at Venus then we would have to send scientist to venus in specially made space crafts to be able to widthstand the dangers of the sulfuric acid in it's atmosphere. n
