dear state senator, i belive we should trash the electoral college and do popular votes. this way it is simiple and easyer to control. people may think they are voting for president when there not (even know they shouod be).we are really voting for electors. i dont see where it is right that thoses electors have to fight for are vote. we should be able to put in are balliets and that be it, not worry weather the electors had a good agument and won the fight. the electors dont always vote for who that state wants. when some people go to vote the are confused on the electores and vote the wrong candidate. the electors dont alawys vote for who we want sometimes they put that voite aside and vote for whom ever they wish. in all realaity we dont need them all they do is cause a mess in the prosses. so i belive that we shuld stop the electoral college and do direct voit insted.
