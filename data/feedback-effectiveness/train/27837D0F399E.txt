I was a Seagoing Cowboy. I help feed the horses that are getting tranported to Europe. I remember that one time I tried to convince some other people to join the program. It didn't go so well.

"I don't like the sea air", "I hate the ocean", " I can't swim", "What we get tropedoed? I can't swim", I have allergies to horses". These are exuses I get when I try to convince other people to join the progam I am in. I did convince some, but not a lot. Most think that I am a creep. They try to get away from me. I am always sad when I see them walk away, but at least I tried. Eventuly I gave up trying to convince them.

So here I am, on the sea, thinking about the people that I tried to get them to join. Every time that I thought about them, I think about what they are doing right now. When I was discharged, I went off to find every single one of the people and tell about my journys. They always say the same thing. "I wish I joined the program." Then we have a good talk about what they did while I was overseas. I feel like that I have more friends than I used to before.
