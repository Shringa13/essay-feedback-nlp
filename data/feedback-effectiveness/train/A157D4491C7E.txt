Dear state senator,

I want to take the time to speak my mind and said whats wrong with the clectoral college.  The electoral college is a process, not a place that what i've read. The founding fathers established it in the constitution between election of the president by a vote in congress and election of the president by a popular vote of qualified citizen. The electoral college consists of 538 elctors. a majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the president. each candidate running for president in your state has his or her own group of electors.

Under the electoral collage system, votets vote not for the prisident, but for slate of elector who there elect the presient. the single best argument against the electoral college is what we might call the disaster factor. the amercan people should consider themselves lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the biggest electoin crisis in a century. consider that state legislatures are technically resonsible for picking electors and those electors could always defy the will of the people. each state casts only one vote, the single  representative from wyoming, representing 500,000 voters,would have as much say 55 representatives from california, who represent 35 millon votes. that  many voters vote one party for president and another for congress.

the electoral college is widely regarded as an anachronism, a non-democratic method of selecting a president  taht ought to be overruled by declaring  the candidate who receives the most popular votes the winner.
