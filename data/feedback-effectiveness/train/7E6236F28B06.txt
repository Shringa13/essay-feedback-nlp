Venus, as the author talks about, was a worthy pursuit becuase they had found very good and ineresting findings. The author believes them because they have such good outcmomes of the new findings. As the author talks about in paragaph 8 it says,"Been tested in a chamber simulation the chaos of Venus. " This meaning to this is how many things had been tested and seen. Therefore they are dicovering new stuff in this century. Another reason is on paragrpah 8 it states,"Striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value." This is explaining how the person doesnt liked the job or does. They are passionate able the stuff they do. As they look into more of Venus, the more excitement is shown and shared. Overall, the author knows how harmful these stuff could be, but they just love how they make a discovery, which is worthy. They feel as to being one step ahead by testing them and keep testing them so they are able to come out with an outcome of something more epic and worthyly of Venus and its dicovering which made it itself a worthy pursuit.
