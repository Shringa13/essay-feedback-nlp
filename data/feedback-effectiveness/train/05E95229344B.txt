When I think about schools, I think about a little community because that's basically what it is. Everyone is together for most of the day,every single day. So yes I agree with everyone doing one extracurricular activity that way everyone has tried it and be part of the community. something to take into consideration is that i dont think the kids will really go.

Now this is a pro or con sustain,not every kid is gonna commit to going. So there's pros and cons in this I know that but deciding if its something I truly believe in then no. Another con about the extracurricular activity is not every parent has time to pick their kid up after school because they rather pick the kids up instead of letting their kid walk home alone. Do I believe this is a good idea? Yes but that's not the question,the question was do I agree with it? No I don't. Im one of the kids that don't have time for this activity so knowing how my day goes and trying to add on it,really isnt gonna be good for me.

For the kids that do have the time and effort to actually do it can do it but it shouldnt have to be pushed on somebody to do it, it just be there like an option just in case you do have extra time and are able to really do it. The kids should want to do these things so they can join but if its not possible then it shouldnt be pushed on them,kids should have a choice if they wanna commit do something like that. The point is most of the kids just don't commit or have time or family events, everyone is different you can't just expect every kid just to go.

So no I dont agree with what the princlai said at all and it should be there for kids to choose it or not for them to force it on the kids.
