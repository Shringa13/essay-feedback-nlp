Yes, I think technology is good for everyone because your computor can tell when you are bored, happy, and sad. I feel like it would be an great idea to create something like this because if you are bored your computor may have something different for you to do instead of sitting there bored about the work you are doing. Also if you are sad and not feeling likr your normal self the computor can cheer you up by doing something to make you feel better. What if you have an computor and it can tell you having mixed emotions and the computor help you with that? I really think if we have this technology today everything would be much better. I say everything would be much better because kids today get bored fast and we need something that would help them not to get bored fast. We really should have an computor that can tell if we'er happy, sad, and even mad because what if it help us out of them type of emotions? What if we'er sad and the computor help us through the day? What if we'er bored and the computor make he work be fun? I really wish we had this type of technologhy in our generation today.
