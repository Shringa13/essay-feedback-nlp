In 1976 pictures where taken of Mars with the Viking 1 spacecraft from NASA. We have dicovered that the pictures look like a face on Mars. We can garentee that "aliens" did not do this. From the data we collected it seems to be that Mars was having formations and the ground/rocks looked like it had shadowed a face.

Over the years as you can tell in the pictures the face begins to form into something different. The "Face" is starting to not look like a face anymore. If there were life on Mars they would try to keep the form from changing, right?

Yes we know what you are thinking, "That cant be Mars doing that," but we have not collected any data of any sign of life on Mars. We have no reason to believe that Mars has any life form of any kind on it. We have seen from other data though that Mars has been changing and the landforms have changed. This is just another formation.

Futhermore we have concluded that the "Face" on Mars is just rock formation. There is no futher information on the "alien" therory and that this is out of the picture.. As you can tell in the picture there is other rocks surrounding it and it is just like the other rocks, they have shadows and the "Face's" shadow is just more life like. The formations of every planet have changed and will continue to change so anything can happen next.
