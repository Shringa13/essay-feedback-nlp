I personally think that there should be an electoral college vote. Not only does it keep the popularity vote out of check, but it also holds a good amount of personality behind the fact that it carries over 100 years of tradition, divide that by 4 years per term of president, thats over 10 presidents that have won their electoral college votes. If they used the popularity vote? We would go insane. If the people realize what  they are talking about, we could go billions of dollars out of our debt hole were in..

Our spending habits these presidents we have had over the past years have lead us into doing? Im surprised were all still alive honestly. Different candidates have different ways of planning their lives in office, their daily commutes, their daily functions, what laws they are going to put into place next, the next time that they will make a public apperence, those kind of things. But when theyre talking about taking electoral college out of play because its "outdated" personally I would say throw them a box of loony toon cereal.

I dont believe in throwing out something our founding fathers came up with. Expecially now that we have so many of our constetutional rights going out of play and being laid to rest for the many  years that they helped serve us justice and made us actually realize our country went to war to fight for our freedom, thats basically taking away our freedom to have who we think is best in office. Everybody talks about both candidates. The  popularity war also wouldnt work because they talk about both of them equally as another citzen would.
