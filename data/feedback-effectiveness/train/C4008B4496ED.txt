In 1976, the Viking 1 set course to mars. When the Viking 1 was orbiting mars, the Mars Global Surveyor took a photo of a strange figure. It looked like a shadowy human face. The question everyone is asking is who are what made this? Was it aliens or is it just natural. If you ask me, this strange looking thing is just a natural landform.

I think it is a landform for a couple of reasons. My first reason is that only a few of my friends from NASA believe that this strange landform was really made by aliens. I also think that this is just a landform because the photo that we took was not very clear and that could have made the landform look like a face.

I also think that this is just a land form because the time of year that we took the one of the photos. When we took the photo in 1998, we took the photo during the winter on Mars and it made Mars sort of cloudy and the Mars Global Surveyer had to peer through the wispy clouds to see the strange landform. Some of my friends from NASA were saying that some of the so called "alien markings" were hidden too.

My final reason for thinking that this is just a landform is that when we took the thre pictures and compared them, they all looked different from each other. The picture we took in 1976 looked like the face the most out of the three pictures. The picture we took in 1998 did not have the same details of the first picture and it did not look like a face. The picture we took in 2001 did not have the facial features of the first photo either. Therefore, I think this is just a landform

In conclusion, I think this is just a landform because only a few of my friends believed that it was done by aliens, the photo we took in 1998 was different due to some of the factors of weather, and all three photos looked different from one another.
