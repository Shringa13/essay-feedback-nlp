Dear State Senator,

I am in favor of keeping the Electoral College or changing it to election by popular vote for the president of the United States. The Electoral College consists of 538 electors. It is very rare that the winner of the electoral vote will not win the national popular vote.

The U.S Chamber of Commerce and some others agreed to abolishing the electoral college. Because of the quirks of the electoral college, won the popular vote but the electoral college still has its defenders. The electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in return elect the president. Although the electoral vote may be unfair to voters it gives the president a better chance of winning the election. There is a dispute over the outcome of an Electoral Colege vote but not likely for the popular vote. For this is because the winning candidates share of the Electoral vote exceeds it's share of the popular vote. For exemple, Obama received 61.7 percent of the electoral vote compared to 51.3 percent of popular votes for him and Romney, in the 2012's election.

The Electoral college requires a presidential candidate to have a trans-regional appeal. If you are a regional favorite, as Romney was in the South, there is no need to campaign big in those states becuase no region has enough electoral votes to elect president. Therefore, Romney gains no electoral votes by increasing his popularity in states he knows he will win. It can be argued that the Electoral College method of selecting the president may turn off potential voters for a candidate who has no hope of carrying their state but, have a less incentive to pay attention to the campaign than they would have if the president were picked by popular vote. Voters in presidential elections are people who want to express a polital preference rather than people who think that a single vote may decide an election.
