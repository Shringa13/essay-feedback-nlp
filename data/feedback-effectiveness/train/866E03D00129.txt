The Facial Action Coding System is an invasion of privacy and should not be used in classrooms or on students. Students should chose when and to who they reveal their emotions, and this system deprives them of that freedom.

As stated in by Nick D'Alto, most human communication is not verbal. Meaning that people express their emotions by their looks or their actions, but they chose when to do this. The Facial Action Coding System takes away this freedom from students, they do not have the choice when to express what they are feeling if anyone can just use a face scanning system on them. " Imagine being able to detect exaclty how other people are feeling, even when they are trying to hide their emotions (D'Alto 1)," this first sentence perfectly shows how it takes away peoples freedom of when they want to express certian emotions tocertian people.

Every human has naturaul rights, and in America everyone has the right to freedom of speech. But part of that right to speech is having the choice not to speak. The Facial action Coding System would take away people's freedom of facial expression or emotion. People should have the right to chose to who and when they express their emotions, and this system takes away these rights.
