Have you ever wanted to help somebody? Everybody should help someone when they are in need. You should always help someone even if you dont know them. Sometimes you should just do thinks to be nice and not for money.

You also get to visit other places and see unusual things. One of the dangers of going on a cattle boat though is being out in the middle of the sea so you always have to watch your back and becareful what you do. One of the good things about going on a cattle boat is when you do go on one you might learn somethings about animals.

Another thing is that you get to help people in need. Another good thing is that you might make a new friend in another country. You also might go back to that country for a trip with your family.

Its nice when your friends ask you to do something like going to another country and helping people out. When you go and help people like Luke did just think about those people and how they felt about you helping them with getting food and water. After your done helping someone in need like Luke did it kinda makes you feel happy that you did that for that person. Plus if you were to go on a cattle boat its not all just work you can also have a little fun playing tennis, boxing, fencing, Table tennis,and whittling and reading. Thats why you should participate in the Seagoing Cowboys program.
