In the booming world today, transportaion is essential. Trying to imagine life without cars for some people is like trying to imagine life without food or water, but cars arent ass essential as we think. But even if you drive a smart car or hybrid, emissions from these cars still affect the world around us. Lowered car use would help this improve. Using less cars would also have more benefits for all of us.

People in a samll town of VAUBAN, Germany have already stopped use of cars. People report to be "Happier without them." Lowering the use of cars would also prevent so much smog in the air. In Paris, France, the warm days and cold night would trap the smog in the air. in order to reduce the amount of smog in the air, on monday drivers with even-numbered liscense plates had to leave their cars at home or face a $31 fine. Then on tuesday, motorists with odd numbered lisence plates had to do the same. This led to decreases in the amount of smog in the air. The warm days and cold night would trap the smog in the air. Another instance is in Bogota, Comlubia, where there was a car-free day. According to buisnessman Carlos Arturo Plaze, "It's a good opportunity to take away stress and to lower the air pollution." This has led to newer sidewalks being paved, and new restraunts and upscale shopping districts to pop up all over the city.

Less cars mean less greenhouse gas emissions, which inturn help our environment. It also leads to less stress and deaths among the people in the city. Less cars are the future of our world, and its not too late to start to help our environment and to help better ourselves.
