By jimmy

NASA`s had send a spacecraft called Viking 1. Many of the people that were working on this were think it was something else. When it came out 1976 many peolpe think it was made by aliens. But on one know that it was. So it be came an icon for the plant mars. Many people think it was aliens that made the face or hills that from the face on mars. 22 years later Mars Global surveyor had a spacecaft that was going aronud mars to the face but when they did they take the image. Many were happy to see other image. But it did not came a clear as they what it to be. But what i think it could be is that a rock may crash into mars and made the face. But over time sand bulid over it gave what it look like in 1976. In the photograph you can see that it maybe face but you can see that it can be a hill. What are the black spot in the photograph that we see here. It could be that is that can be made on mars by wnich it from by.
