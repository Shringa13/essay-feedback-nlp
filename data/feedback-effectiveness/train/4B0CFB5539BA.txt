To: Principal

Policy 1 is a good considering policy. I think we should do that at SCHOOL_NAME because we are not allowed to have cell phones so this is a good way to show the principal that we are responsible. If we use it in class we should get it taken but not from everybody but just for that person who didn't do what she/he was told. I would like this policy in the school.

If we get this policy we should be able to show our principal that we are young adults. If we have this policy i am going to be happy cause this a change to show our principal that we can do it without her telling us because we are older to know what's right from wrong. That's a good idea to do because what if something goes wrong and you need your mom ,you can always call her at lunch if you need her. If u need some advice and you don't want to go to your principal u should be able to call your mom at lunch. That's all I have to say bye.
