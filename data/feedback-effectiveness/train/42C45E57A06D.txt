My opinion is that we be able to vote saying the most popular votes win because why would we give are opinion and stating it if it doesn't matter? Well according to the 1st source the electorial college process consists of a selection if the electors wich is were they go and have a big meeting of the electors and who is gonna win President or vice president, They look over the counting electoral votes by the congress. I think having the most popular would be better because then most people wont get mad or cause problems because they got to say who they want so its not picked by other people stating that there opinion doesn't matter when really it does. people get to pick who they want by why pick it if you dont pick he most popular vote ,because what if we dont like what you pick ?

under the electoral college you vote for a state of electors witch meaning you would be voting for the state and the electoral college would vote for president you wouldn't , voters in hawaii and ohio were 3,687 voters had voted the other way. The election is only a few swing voters away from catastrophe. at the most basic level the eletroral college are unfair to voters because the winner takes all. what do they mean by winner takes all ? why cant they share half and half its not fair that all the other people running trying to protect and help are country and do all these things dont get any sort of winner thing, to me that is unfair we have people that wanna help and protect us and you say winner takes all i think we should at least share with the other people running. they say in the paragraph 'everyone's president a solid regional favorite such as romney was in the south has no incentive to compaign heavily in those states  for he gains no electioral votes  by increasing his plurality instates that he knows he will win wich meaning he is saying he knows he will win , so thats my opinion we should have the most popular votes win to see who will be president and vice prsident.
