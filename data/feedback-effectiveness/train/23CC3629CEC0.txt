To whom it may concern:

I know you are trying to decide if all students should participate in community service. I am writing this so you have a better point of view of a student . I think we should have to do some kind of community work because it could help us students have a better look into life, have a better appreciation of what you and teachers do for us and we can kind of learn what we want to do when we're older. I know that most of the other students probably don't want to have that happen. Now you know at least one student wants it.

The reason that we could a better look at life is we could help younger kids like teachers do and might want to become a teacher in the future. We could also use the experience as we get older in jobs or with our own life style. this like a prospect that we use to our advantage. It could help some us be less likely to become criminals. It will probably be one of the best things that could happen to certain students.

We could have a better appreciation for you because we can better see how hard you work with us. Then we can behave better during school and not be like delinquents all the time. I know your probably having a lot of doubt about this and us as your students should be happy with what ever you decide to do.

The reason it will help us students chose what we want to be when we grow up is that we could become professional tuters or want to be sometung
