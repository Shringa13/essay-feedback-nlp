The technology that is being deveolped is valuable because in situations wehn someone doesnt want to talk or refuse to in a crisis they can read ther emotions and seek a better way of talking with them. also a lot of schools do a horrible almost a illegal jobs and reading kids emotions and helping there students so if this technology was used in schools teachers might actually have a chance at doing there jobs which they need to get better soon. this topic is useful in a lot of ways hostage situations interagations helping disabled people in schools which we all know need help this program could do wonders for people but if they use it to much and make it to logical we could lose sight of how to properly use it to many rules treating to many people the same would destory it because everyones different even if they feel the same way as other people some have a chip on ther shoulder and others own the world to many differences to make this system properly work and functio in a way we all wish it could but it would be to complex and overcompilcated might be a fun app on your phone but not for statewide adminastraion use it would be corrupt and wrong it would only be used to hurt not help
