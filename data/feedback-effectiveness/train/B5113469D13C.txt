The unmasked face of mars had remained a mystery to others, so researchers have been trying to uncover what the face of Mars actually meant. Some say that aliens made it, but others said that it is a landform. When NASA discovered a shadowy likeness that almost resembled a face, Mars made or evelated a new Landform that resembled a face. The face of Mars may have been popular, but everone in the world was oblivious, yet so indesicive about what Mars really showed other than a face. Conspiracy theorists have no proof that Alien life form existed in Mars. "We felt this was important to taxpayers." No alien mounument is proven but a new landform spouted into place which resembled a face. Not every researcher or anyone was satisfied, so though the face of Mars has been proven either a mystery or scientists are still researching about how the landform looked like a face. Never the less, after a few years later, Malin's team shot a photo that was extraordinary using the maximum resolution.

The pixels showed clear hard proof, in the one 2001 image spans that are 1.56 meters,and compared 43 meters per pixel in the best and original 11976 photo. Not everyone can agree that the face of Mars is just a landform or alien life; thus the face or landform still remained as an anonomys fact of mystery.
