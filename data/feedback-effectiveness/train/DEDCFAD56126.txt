Dear Principal,

All people are entitled to an opinion. My opinion is that community service should be required. Some people think that community service is a waste of time but they don't know how it can change your outlook on life. It can look good on college and job applications. If you wanted to be a teacher, you could go to a local elementary school to read or tutor children of all ages. It tells people that your dedicated to your job. Little things like this can do wonders.

Community service also builds life long friendships. You can meet people that are interested in the same things you are. You don't always have to give your life up to community service. You can work at a soup kitchen at lunch or set up fund raisers for people with special needs.

This also can help you conquer fears. With friends that you trust on your side you can conquer anything.

Many people think its a waste of time but they don't know how fulfilled you feel after you help. It also shows many people that their lucky not to be living in homeless shelter or begging for food on the streets. It makes them think twice before taking everything for themselves.

It also shows skills that they didn't think they were capable to do.

This is why i believe Community service should be required.

-Sincerely A Student
