Dear Principle,

Phones are a huge part of our children's lives.

In your first policy you state that you could,

"Allow students to bring phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times, as long as the phones are turned off during class time."

In your second policy you state that you, " Do not allow students to have phones at school at all."

In my opinion policy number one is the best decision that you could make regarding the students.

The reason i say this is because by letting them have there phones, even at a potion of time, you would not have them sneaking them around as often.

Your letting them have some freedom when it comes to communication, but at the same time you have control over them.

If you chose the second policy you would have a lot of angry parents at your door.

Parents and children need to communicate, and they do this, most often than not, on there phones.

If you took away the only way parents could communicate and talk to their children, all these parents would be upset, and of course worried.

For you see, they would not know if there children were home or gone off to friends house, and they couldn't just call them up and ask because there phones would be with them, but at home.

So, please take into consideration what I've said to you.

Sincerely, student
