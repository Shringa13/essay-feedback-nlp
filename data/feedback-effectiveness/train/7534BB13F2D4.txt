Phones and driving

The National Safety Council reports that cell phone use while driving leads to 1.6 million crashes each year. That's out of control. America has an addiction problem, and it's all about cell phones. You see ads on tv, on your phone, on billboards, pretty much everywhere, and they are taking american lives.

There's a lot of problems phones bring to the table, but Americans getting distracted by them is one of the most common causes of death in the us. One quick peek at your phone and suddenly there's a semi truck coming at you 100 miles per hour. It can happen in almost an instant. And the numbers are there to back it up! There is no way more than 25% of the people killed per year expected or saw the crash coming.

The government has taken slow action, creating the "hands-free" law. This law makes it illegal to touch your phone while driving at all, but it isn't exactly being enforced. Sure, cops are now allowed to arrest people for touching their phone, but it just made people hide their phone better while driving, which honestly causes more accidents.

There are so many ways to fix this problem. For example, apple could make a feature where when your phone is moving above a certain speed, your phone locks itself until you have stopped moving. While Apple has a feature like this, it's easily avoidable as there's a button on the screen that opens your iphone.

I hope these essays give you a reason not to touch your phone while driving. It's just seconds before you realize what's happening, and there's no going back when you cant even see what's coming. It takes little to no effort to put down your phone, and the same amount of effort to stop yourself from picking it up. Drive safe!
