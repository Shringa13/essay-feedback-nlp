Dear Senator,

I would like to argue in favor of keeping the Electoral College. I believe that having an Elecotral college vote helps the President have a greater chance of becoming elected. This process also makes it a fair game of becoming elected for President.It's not only about the President though. When you vote for a presidential candidate you're actually voting for a slate of electors.

As I mentioned before, having and electoral votes makes it fair game for everyone. It states that the Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal. This means that the presidential candidate cannot get votes based on the region they are from. No region has enough electoral votes to elect a President. He gains no votes by increasing pluraity in states that he knows he will win. This results with unlikely success of the President.

The Electoral College restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states lose by virtue of the mal-apportionment of the Senate decreed in the Constitution. The Electoral College avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate recieves a majority of the votes cast. When no candidate wins a majority of the vast cast, it causes complications in the presidential election process. That's when the Electoral College steps in and prodices a clear winner.

Sure it can be argued that the Electoral College method of selecting the president may not be the best way of geting potential voters for a candidate, but the way they do things makes it fair game. It keeps the system balanced. The Electoral College is an established compromise in the Constitution brought on by the Founding Fathers. It's something original that I think should live on instead of being taken away. The Electoral College should stay.
