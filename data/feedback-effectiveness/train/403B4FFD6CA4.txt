I think that the Electoral College is a bad way of picking a president, because as Americans , we have the freedom of speech and that should include voting as well. the Electoral College system works and for some states it "fits the shoe," for example California, they have 55 representatives .

The Electoral College allows the electoral votes to be given out by the voters and the population in that state may never actually honestly choose who they want in office . in other cases itthe presidential canidates have  more intrest in the bigger states such as Florida. that could boost in the jobs, and advanteges in the bigger states.

In defense of the Electoral College , it can be a faster way to elect a new president , it also allows people to lose intrest since their votes don't effect much in the long run. the votes of the people should effect who should be in office because with what I know about the Electoral College, it could break a country. It takes away freedom of speech. But helps the canidate(s) from your state , which can possibly help your state in the long run .

The popular votes allows you to choose who you want to be in office and if the person you voted for lost , at least you had your vote. You can easily have had you vote given to someone and they could have had cheated you out .

If the Electoral College is kept going then there should be some changes to how it is done. For example , the small states have less say in what happens compaired to the bigger states like California and Florida . It should balance out so that it can be fair but also equaled out.
