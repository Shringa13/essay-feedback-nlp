I don't believe a technology can identify human emotions. Because I think we all fakes our smiles sometimes, let's say that I don't feel good or I am angry, but I don't anyone or anybody to know how I feel because I am pretty sure not everyone of us is always ready to let people know how they are feeling, we fake our smile and still smile but we don't really mean it, we smile out side but we feel like crying inside, and most of the time if you come out and say how you are feeling no one will notice it except if you tpld them yourself, so what I am trying to say is that a computer cannot tell whether a person is happy, sad, fear,angry. and in the second paragraph it says that we or computer can "calculate" our emotions and I still don't believe that can ever happen because we express how we feel we can't count our emotions.

"Hold on! can we actually "calculate" emotions-like math homework? And how can a computer reconize the subtle facial movement we humans use to express how we feel?"

It's not true at all, there is no way a computer can tell me when I am happy and when I am not happy, maybe I am faking, maybe I don't even even want to show my feelings.
