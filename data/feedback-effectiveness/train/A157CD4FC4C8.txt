the reason why their is the techonoly of people to know how to understand on how the reason the potrites are in this world today. By showing on how the way the pictures in the text is showing how she is smileing. I think we should leave her face the way is orginally on the way it is from the way the arginol person painted it. It is being very respectful on how the painting is being displaied in different musemes here around the world.

the reason why I think this is because lets say that we painted something and someone goes in and paint it completely different. Than what you made it to be in the first place. So I feel like we all should leave things they were when they were created. The respect we give we get in return from the same reson y we gave it to others because the more you give the more it looks good on you in the long run. So just remember that the next time you see someone changing someone else's painting or others works. They work so hard on because why would they work so hard on somthing that someone else is just gonna go back in and change it.
