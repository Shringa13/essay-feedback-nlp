I bet your wondering what a Electoral college is in your head ,

well an Electoral college is not somewhere you go to like a regular college but its a process ,

they established it in constitution as a compromise.

Its where they vote for presidents and vice president including the electoral votes by congress ,

Electoral college consists 538 electors and the majority of 270 electoral votes to elect the president .

To begin with, every candidate is running for President for your state ,and each of them has their own electors .

After every four years presidential election is held on tuesday after the first monday ,

the fun part is that most states gets a "winner-take-all" system that awards all the electors to the winning presidential candidate ,

also your governer prepares a "Certificate of Ascertainment"

listing all the wonderful candidates who ran for President in your state along with the names of their respective electors .

This year most voters are expecting another close election in the population vote which winners could again lose the presidency.

Under electoral college system some voters don't vote for presidents but vote for a state of electors , if you lived in texas for an example and wanted to vote for someone named John kerry you would vote for a slate of 34 Democratic electors pledged to Kerry .

For the winner-take-all method of the award electoral votes induces the candidates just like in 2012 election .Obama won the vote and got 29 electoral votes ,a large state gets more attention from presidential candidates in the campaign

Nixton in 1968 and Clinton in 1992 both had a 43 pecent plurality of popular votes .

But hopefully you learned about the Electoral College and what it really isÂ  ,and what the electors have to go through to be president.
