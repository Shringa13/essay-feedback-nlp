Dear Principal,

I think students who have less than a B average should be able to do sports, because doing sports teaches us students responsibility, and self discipline. It might not seem like it to you, but coming from a student who enjoys sports, I know how it makes most students act, and feel.

I think you should at least give the students a chance to show you that they would be able to get their grade up so they could play on teams and show their pride for their school. I know I enjoy getting out there, and just playing what I want to play. It motivates me to do my homework, study for tests, focus more in class. That seems to be one of the problems why you don't want students doing sports, because you want them to focus more on their work, well, I'm not sure that would be the best idea.

A lot of students find it irritating that they can't play because of their work, or grades, or something like that. And It makes them not want to do any other work. I'm sorry if this sounds rude, but I am just trying to let you know how the other students would probably feel about this. I just don't think it's fair that some students wouldn't be able to play because of a grade. Maybe if they had a failing grade then I would say no they shouldn't be able to play. But it's not a failing grade and you should give them the chance to show themselves that they can focus on their work, and still play the sport they love to play.

Yes, some students might not be as devoted as other students to get their work done, but definitely most students would think that if they can't play a sport then they better get their work done. It's just depends on the kid, but I know most of us teenagers would definitely try for that spot on the team if we just got the chance!

Sincerely,

A Student
