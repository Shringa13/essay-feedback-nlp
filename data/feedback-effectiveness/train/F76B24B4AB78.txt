This artical is telling us how Venus get called " Evening Star." Venus is a planet in our solar system not everyone knows that because some people don't care.

But what people didn't know about Venus is that humans have sent numerous spacecrafts to Venus. The thing about Venus is that everytime we send a spacecraft is only lasts for a few hours. They're going to try sending more spacecrafts because "Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limitdating endeavors"

When they called Venus "Evening Star" beacause during the evening you could see Venus so clear. The reason why you could seen Venus not just because how bright Venus was but also because Venus is closer to us then you think. BUt the point of the nickname is because Venus is a misleading panet in our solar system.

We say that Earth and Venus are twins because Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size. People might think that when we say twins they might think that everything is the say on Venus but nobody know how Venus looks like because everytime we send the spacecraft in only last for a few hours. Never enough hours or days to see everything we want to see and view. The speed of Venus "means orbit the sun at different speeds." This probably mean why not spaceship don't last for very long in Venus.

"The atmosphere on Earth 97 percent dioxide blankets Venus." Which makes that it's going to be more hard than we thought. Even though it might be more complicated we're still going to find a way. We want to know everything on Venus

So what are going to try doing is keep sending spacecrafts because" Our travels on Earth and beyond should not intimedating endeavors" what they mean by this is that they aren't going to stop untiul they find a way to be on Venus longer than a few hours.
