the presidental election is to find a new leader of the united states he basicly has to pass laws and do taxes we vote to make sure we get the right president we dont want someone thats gonna make silly laws and taxes the people to much the president has to take charge has to go to  world meetings has to be a role model for the younger people in the world the president has to do alot of work now the vice president has to do what the president cant do sometimes other times hes just there to help the president when he needs him like when the presidents gone on vaction the vice president does his work for him but sometimes the vice president messes up with paperwork so thats why we need to chose the best president not someone random that makes silly laws and to mess up on paperwork and to raise the taxes on the people the president also helps with things going on around the world he also a role model not only to college kids but to highschool kids to so thats why we vote not to pick someone to be specail for the job but to be specail rolemodel for the younger kids he also needs to speak for the people and for his country not for taxeing people or makeing laws its about the people always has been always will be about the people its up to older people and college kids to chose the perfect president if we chose the wrong president are country chould fail  and laws chould be broken and taxes whould be high and fights whould happen just one president chould ruin it all for everyone the majority of the college students vote but some dont cause they dont care or either dont beleave in voteing for a guy to run our country some older people dont care for it either but they vote anyway the vice president cant do some of the jobs that our president can do like things to do with the army or with other world leaders it takes alot of skills to deal with alot of screaming people at you like big world leaders yelling at you all day cause you did something wrong or they did something wrong to eachother but the president does a good job cause we voted for a guy that can handle this job that he can handle them yelling at him he can take the pressaure of being a role model a president a father a teacher cause hes basicly teaching the college kids dont give up on your goals they can happen maybe one day a college student wants to be president and the president is their rolemodel basicly he has to teach the world that dont give up when the going gets tough cause if you do then you wont get anywhere in life but if you work hard you can do anything thats why we vote for the president not for a leader whos  bossy and throws laws in our faces but a president whos a rolemodel a teacher a father a leader only one state casts one vote the single representavite from wyoming represents 500,000 voters so image that many voters voteing for one guy to run for our country thats alot of voters but we need that many votes cause we dont know if we pick the right president or the wrong one until he gets into office and starts makeing taxes and laws then we can tell if hes a good president or a bad one we spend a week after just watching what the new president does under pressure he has to go under some tests for a couple of weeks befor we know if hes bad or not the president has to get use  to guards being around him every where he goes cause they have to protect him from danger like bombs and other stuff the president is targeted alot because hes the rolemodel for the usa so are enemies want to hurt him so thats why hes guarded 24/7 every day and every night and even when the presidents done being the president they still have guys protecting them from danger.
