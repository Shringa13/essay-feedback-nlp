Dear Flordia senator,

I would like to in favor of keeping the Electoral College for many purposes. The Electoral College know the process of becoming a president and some of the people voting dont really know how the process works. The eletors are the one to elect the president and not the people,people's vote will not have any affect of the election of the president.

The electoral college knows the process of becoming a president ,some citizens dont really know the process of becoming a president. what if we the people just vote and we dont know if our vote counts. The excerpt states"when you vote for a presidential candiate you're actually voting for a slate of electors". This indicates that we think our vote if for the election of the president but its not. Therefore,we should pay attention of who we elect and knowing how the voting system work out. keep on mind that the electoral college is a good system and that we should count on them.

Do you know who elects the president? well,its the electoral college the one who elects the president,many people think that we the people choose but,they are actually wrong. "270 electoral votes is requierd to elect the president",this indicates that we dont really have control of picking the president. "it's possible that the winner of the electoral vote will not win the national popular vote", but does'nt often happen.

It all comes down to one point,we should let the Electoral College choose who they want to elect the president. We all want different people to be president but at the end we have too choose who will help the U.S to be powerful. Our nation wll be ruled by the people and for the people.
