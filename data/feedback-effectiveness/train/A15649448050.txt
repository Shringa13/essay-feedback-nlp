In the article "Unmasking the Face on Mars" in NASA they are arguing and discussing what or who made the face. Some NASA people are thinking that the face was made naturaly. Others are saying that aliens used rocks and other things to create it.

The face on Mars is probaly naturally made because if you look at the images in the beginnig of the article, it has three different dates. If you look at the first one, 1976, you can see the face clearly. In 1998, the face is starting to get a little blery. Now at 2001, you barely see the face, in fact there is not a face anyone.

If this face was man-made or made by aliens, the shouldn't the face be more clearly in 1976. If man did make this face, how would they get there in the first place.

The face on Mars would be naturally made, cause no human or alien could make this.
