Can you see the emotions in the Mona Lisa? A latest technology that can recognize emotions was the latest innovation from Prof. This technology claims it has the ability to read every emotion, even in pictures. Is this a reliable technology or is this something that isnt exact?

The recent technology on seeing emotions talks about how the Mona Lisa is 83 percent happy, 9 percent disguested, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry. How can we know if this is true because we were not there to tell what her emotions where. Yes you can see some emotion in her painting, because it states that Da Vinci studied the human anatomy so that it would help him with painting facial muslces precisely to show emotion.

This technology can be good for some purposes. Dr. Huang makes a statement saying, "A classroom computer could tell when a student is becoming confused or bored, then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human structor." This is a good factor, because this can help students with school so theyre not falling behind.

Overall this technology may have some pros, and it has some cons. If you put it to good use like for instince helping kids when theyre confused or bored it will show them other ways which is good. Then you have your cons. This technology might not always be precise and at some point this could lead to problems when trying to solve a serious situation. This technology is realiable at some points, theyre are multiple ways it can help and then there can be some disfunctions. Every technology has their flaws though.
