Dear Principal TEACHER_NAME,

Many people enjoy the idea of community service; others do not.

I believe that students have the right to choose what they would rather do, instead of being forced to do so.

Some kids already do some community service.

It would mainly affect the kids that don't.

Even though community service is the right thing to do, it should not be forced upon anybody.

The students need some of their own freedom.

We are already facing being a teenager and school.

We need to be able to make a few more decisions in our everyday lives.

On the other hand, every student performing community service will help the city extremely well.

The streets will be cleaner, the buildings shinier, and the gardens greener.

Everyone in the city will leave their homes with a smile on their face!

For example, one of my friends volunteers at an elementary school as a tutor.

He enjoys it a lot, especially when one of the kids gets a good grade on something he taught them.

However, some of my other friends don't like the idea of community service because it takes away from their free time.

Personally, I am not liking the idea of being forced to make the city a better place.

It shouldn't be part of the curriculum.

The students should make the decision themselves.

Thank you,

STUDENT_NAME
