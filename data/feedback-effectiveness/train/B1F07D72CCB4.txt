If I was a scientist I would convience them that the face in the ground was just a natural landform in many ways. Some people around the world think things like this would be great to brag about. In this sitiuation We're trying to convience people and tell them that aliens has nothing to do with this.

In this article, it says that it isn't alien related. Reasons that I would conclude is, as scientists research it is just a landform. Scientists also says that its just another Martian mesa. It's related to the red planet Cydonia. As the one scientist took it among himself and took the picture alot of times just to get a great angle of it everyone was waiting for it. Even web surfers this was a huge impact on the people believing that it was a alien.

As I read more not all the people were ok with the problem. Seems that scientists had found more. If I were a scientist I would gather evidence and all my documents from things that were related to this previous sitiuation.

I would also show them pictures back then of the planet. It would be amazing because as a scientist you should always check for yourself. If you did a previous report on that planet or subject I think you should bring your old evidence and documents out to make things come together to understand better.

In this article, I've learned alot about what scientists go through and they they busy life is. It was exciting reading about this and exploring something like this.
