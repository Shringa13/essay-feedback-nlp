I do not have a drives license nor do I have a learners permit. If I did have any of the two I would be against the fact about a self driving car.

I do think that it is a good idea, but it prohibits new learners from driving the correct way. It may be very expensive to purchase this kind of technology. I am also uncomfortable with the car having cameras everywhere including inside of it. It might make the driver feel strange knowing that they are being watched and the car is invading their privacy. Another reason why I do not like it is hackers could hack the system and cause someone to crash into something and cause the passengers to get seriously injured. Also their could be a time where the car malfuntions and crashes. I think that if this driverless car idea does not work out he way that Google planned it to be then they would lose lots of money. People all over the world may or may not like considering the fact that it is new to the world and it is not normal to have someting drive for them.

I think that this self-driving car is a bad idea becuas it myay be dangerous to people all over the world.
