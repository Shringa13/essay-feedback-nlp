dear principal,

I think that you should let the students bring there cell phones to school and let them use it during free and at lunch. So you should use policy1 cause if you don't then their going to bring them so many times. It would be better like that. Because everyone will love using their phones with out having to sneak it even at lunch or in the morning.

You really should do that but don't get angry if they forget to turn off their cell phones cause a lot of kids always forgets i do. And so does my friends. Also i would use policy 2 cause no one would for get to turn off their cell phones. But they would be making explanation to have their phones .

So i would pick policy 1 but if their using it in class then i would take policy 2 to teach them a lesson. I wouldn't care if they got mad serve them right. So remember always be fair especially if it's about phones everyone again I'm going to say everyone loves their phones. I would take in to consideration that you would select policy 1

Please pick policy 1 cause kids won't have to sneak phones to lunch in the morning or in class you would be doing all of us a favor. Also maybe they would pay more attention in class just maybe. It would be good for the school, for the district and for the students.
