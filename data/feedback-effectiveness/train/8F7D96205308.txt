People should agree that the face on Mars was probably an accident. The face probably was not a face, it could have been another Martian mesa. A rock os some type could have hit it or a meteor could also. Next, NASA took pictures of it, and NASA was researching it and studying it, so they can get more information on it. After studying it, they took a picture of it, and they engaged the public with it.

People started to have debates about the picture and what it could have ment. "Some people think the Face is bona fide evidence pof life on Mars." The others are trying to protect it so NASA could be a little bit safer. The picture did look like an Egyptian Pharaoh. NASA said it was a "huge rock information" because it is very similar to a human's face. Next, you cannot just asumed the planet was made from aliens because there is a human's face on it. You got to study the artifact before you can assume it is from aliens.

After that, you got to be able to back up your answer , and saying why it is not a face. "Thousands of anxious web sufers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL website, revealing a natural landform."

People can asume it is a human's face because it look likes it. Another thing is that there is human's face on it, can mean life on the planet, Mars. Also the rock or the artifact does have an Egyptian Pharoah, it could mean a human was at one point up there. It probably is possible to have civilization on Mars.

In conclusion, the artifact could have just been hit by a rock. People need to belive most things that are not really true.
