Is Venus worthy pursuiting despite the dangers it presents? I am going to show you both sides why it would be good to go and why it wouldn't be good to go. Venus is a planet and it is neighbor to earth and is the close planet to earth. It is like eath twin. Lets start talking about why it would be worthy to see venus despite the dangers.

Have you ever wanted to go to other planet to see what it is like? Why don't you go to venus. It is close to earth. In the text it says that "NASA possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientist to float above the fray." It also says that " not a single spaceship has toched down on venus in more then three decases. No spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours and no one had ever been there." You could be the first one to land on Venus. This proves that since it is a dangers planet it would still be worthy seeing it. Now, lets talk about why it wouldn't be worthy seeing it.

Would it really be worth seeing Venus because it had a lot of danger. It says in the text that "A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus. Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere." It also states that " On the planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahernheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own plantet." This proves that it would not be worth going to Venus.

Is venus worth going to despite that dangers that it holds. No it is not worth going to. The planet is 800 degrees Fahernheit. You will not survie that long on that planet but it would be cool to go to a planet no one has ever been to though.
