Dear state senator, I am against the decison to keep the

Electoral College one reason because the candidate running for President isnt being voted for their electors are.

I agree it should change to election by popular vote.

I agree with the election by popular vote because as i stated the people do not vote for the candidate they vote for the electors representing the candidate , then in the passage I learned the electors then elect the President , as I was reading i saw a few name s mentioned in favor of , as it was stated Abolishing the electoral college .

As I read i saw why some might say keep the Electoral College , Al Gore ran for President and won by popular vote thanks to the electoral college , maybe becasue its a by luck situation because it was two parts you had to win as President , they may dont see it as a fault on Electoral College part because it did say he won by popular vote thanks to the electoral college.

Bob Dole agree with the choice of abollishing the Electoral College , some says its unfair outdated , and irrational . The decison to keep the Electoral College should is a win or lose situation because as i read i didnt see a lot of proof of people being for the decison on keeping the Electoral College to make the right decison they sh
