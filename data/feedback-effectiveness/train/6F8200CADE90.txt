The Facial Action Coding System technology that let you reads emotional expressions of students. I strongly disagree with this statement because emtions is not some that you can just get a computer software to scan you to let you know if your happy or sad. How can a computer just express how humans feel emotions are some you feel when another person tell you that you are speacial, and not by letting a computer tell you. Computers are program to do what you wan them to do and help with things such as homework, research pappers and essays they are a software system bulit to help you with over the site needs.

Dr. haung and his collegue are experts at developing better ways for humans and computers to communicate. I feel like you can't just program a computer to pick what emotions you think students are feeling,a and what if the software system was wrong and thats not what the student was feeling. Emotions are a feeling you get when you feel like you don't have a care in the world , or when that special someone makes you happy because they smiled at you those are emtions they are inside you not on a machine that was bulit by man to tell you how you feel.

And in my conclusion the facial expressions for each emoion are univeral oberves,and even though individuals show varying degress of expressions. Each student have the own facial expression is compared aginst a neutral face showing no emotion in a student face. A machine that will let you know if a student is borde or confused is good but that's why we have are own voice to let our teacher know that we need help.
