The use of technology can be operated for many different reasons. Is technology valuable for emotional expressions of students in a classroom?

Everyone has their own opinion in the use of technology based on facial expressions. In my opinion, I believe reading emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable. This can be taught as if you we're being instructed by math. You may be thinking to yourself "How can this be possible for a computer to be recognized by a facial expression?" According to the passage, the computer process begins using a 3-D computer model of the face. The appromixate number of 44 muscles must move just like a human. A man, Dr. Paul Eckman created six different emotions such as, happy, surprised, angry, sad, fear, and disgust. Then each characteristic would be assocaiated by the moventment of the facial muscles.

This technology can be helpful for students because of new emotion-recognized software tracks these facial movements. By weighting the different units, the software can identified by the using mixed emotions. Each emotion is compared against neutral face, in other words no expression shown. You can tell the difference of a person's face of how they're feeling just by looking at their face. But they might alsp, have other feelings within inside them. The new software stories similar anatomical information as an electic code.
