Why should you join the Seagoing Program? There are many reasons you should. I had an amazing experience being a Seagoing cowboy myself. I think that you would also have an amazing experience. I got the chance to have this experience and it was honestly life changing. You might not want to do it because of being on the ship, but you can still have fun while on the ship. While on board you have a good time to enjoy playing games and doing your hobbies, here are some, table tennis,fencing,boxing,reading, and whittling.

When you're on the ship your demeanor will change right when you see the marvelouse sights. I had the experience of touring the excavated castle in Crete, seeing Europe and China, and marveling at the Panama Canal while on my way to China. As you arrive at where you are going, something to give you reassurance is knowing that you are doing something good. You are helping people rebuild and recover what they had lost. I had the I'm-on-top-of-the-world feeling as soon as I knew I was helping them get back what they had lost, and I think you will too. This chance is big for you.

''Boom!'' You think in your mind as you look back at the distruction from the war and bombs. That melancholy feeling you get as you see all that has went on will change as you think of why you are there, and what you are doing. I know that you should join this program because it is a once-in-a-life-time chance. You will have fun as I did in my exuberant experience in this program. I have given examples to why I think you should. Just join the program and you will like it, I can promise you that.
