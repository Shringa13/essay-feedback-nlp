Dear principal I think policy number 1 is better than policy number 2 . My reason are that maybe the person forgot to bring something he or she needed to bring to school or to class. The other thing that could happen is that the person does not feel good and wants to go home. The other thing that could happen is that the person got dirty or fell in the mud and he or she does not have extra cloth to put on. The other thing that could happen is that the person has to stay after school because he or she did something bad or did not do the homework. The other reason is that they play in a sport or stay after school but the coach or the person that stay after school had a to do something and left early . My other reason could be that the person forgot to bring a book for a class and they need it. The other reason is that the person does not have money and they need money to buy something they need , or they need money to get in train . My other reason is that the parent needs to sign a field trip slip so he or she could go to the field trip.

Those were my reason why is policy 1 is better than policy number 2.
