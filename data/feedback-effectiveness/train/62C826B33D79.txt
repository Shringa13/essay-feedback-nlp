Dear state senator, i argue you that we keep the electoral collage because of its many pros. Taking away the electoral college would be like taking away an important part of our U.S history, the founding fathers established it in the constitution as a compromise between election of the president by a vote in congress and election of the president by a popular vote of qualified citizens.

With the electoral college there would be more discussion on the topic of making smart descions to electing a president. Keeping the electoal college will keep a professional way of electing a president. The electoral college selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the partys nominee (and the trust given is rarely betrayed). With that said, it will be a fair and most likely a cheat free zone.

The electoral college avoids the problem of elections in which no canidate receives a majority of the votes cast. When a run off happens this creates pressure of the voters, until the help of the electoral college comes in, which in this case helps break everything up and claim a true winner. For example, in 1968 nixon and clinton in 1992 both had only 43 percent plurality of the popular votes, while winning a majority in the electoral college, 301 and 370 electoral votes, respectively. And that concludes why i argue you to keep the electoal college and not popular vote.       Â
