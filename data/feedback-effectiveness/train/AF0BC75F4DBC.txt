I am arguing to change the ways of the Electoral College vote. I think the popular vote is a great way for us to express our own opinions. where as on the other hand there is only a small group deciding, which isnt fair, we should have our own say too. Afterall, he is going to be our president not just the 538 electors. "Its official: The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational," says Bradford Plumer. some people may wander whats wrong with the electoral college? why isnt that a good idea? well in source two of mine it says "Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electorors, who in turn elect the president." its also stated that "at the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters. because of the winner-take-all system in each state, candidates dont spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the "swing" states."
