The author gives good reasonings on why the idea of studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers. The first reasoning that the author has is that way back when, Venus might have had open oceans and could have supported various forms of life. Just like Earth does, the planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar feartures such as moutains, valleys, and craters. NASA has an exquisset idea for sending humans to study Venus. Just picture an enormous blimp-like contraption that hovers 30 or so miles above all of the landscapes, all of the storms, we would be care free. Nothing to worry about except for the drastic temperatures of 170 degrees Fahrenheit that we all would still have to endure while we're there, but no worries we could always just fan eachother with a paper fan.

It 'll work the same I'm sure. We would have solar powered appliences so we wouldn't have to sorry about the everyday hassal of having to plug in, detangle, of trip over any more cords. This would be a major change for all of us drastic in fact, but still survivable. NASA has had some simpified electronics made of silicon carbide that have been tested in a chamber simulated the Venus's surface and has lasted for three weeks in such harsh and mild conditions. NASA would be making our living situations a lot easier to handle of Venus by creating all of this new technology today in this age/era.

In clonclusion, NASA has outstanding creations that would be outstandingly suitable for the human race to live on Venus. Worry free, hardly any bills to pay, and all liveable cercumstances. Also that the author's idea of studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite of all of the dangers that come with The planet.
