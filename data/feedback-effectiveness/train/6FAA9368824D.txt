This could be it, the new Facial Action Coding System ! This system is a very unique way to tell and spoil how you are really feeling and what your emotions are. This new system starts with a 3-D computer model and all of the human muscles. It will basically scan your face and tell you your emotions. I think this is a fantastic way to get people to change there mood or to tell how people really feel because people hide there emotions and this system could be a new big thing.

Some people may not agree on many things, but maybe people could try this. Some adults worry about how student or there children are feeling and if they did the Facial Action Coding System it would be a way to express there emotions and tell how they really feel. It's as simple as a fake or real smile, the rising of an eyebrow, or even the squinting of your eyes. All of those qualities can tell you what your emotions are with using the Facial Action Coding System. Like the passage states, " The Mona Lisa demomstration is really intended to bring a smile to your face ", and so could the FACS. Seeing student down isn't pleasent and shouldn't be. Using the FACS is a way to tell, but don't put on a fake smile !

The Facial Action Coding System could go world wide and change lives. It could go to every school and make a difference ! This system could be valuable but some people may see it different. Not everyone would want to do this because some don't want to express there emotions. If schools invested in this system, it could change those that don't want expressed to being expressed and happier. It could also just tell you where your're at and what emotions you could work on or otherwise. Some may like, and some may not. Reasearchers show the putting on a "

Real Smile " can make you happier and change your mood. The science of emotions could be a thing of the future, but even more so with the Facial Action Coding System.
