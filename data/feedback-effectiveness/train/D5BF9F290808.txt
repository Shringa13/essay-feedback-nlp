Port S.t Lucie FL . MONTH_DAY_YEAR

Good morning Mister senator for start I have to thank you for your work and all the good things that you do for us. In first stay I want to tell you that this letter is mainly for  remind you your promises when you weren't the senator of the state ,so this is for the welfare of the inhabitants in this place. May be you are very busy in the business or the trips for the improvement in the state, but we need your help to try recover the old time or to begin  the change in the state .

Your understanding can save all the memories and also can help you in your work or things that you have to do for the improvement,you don't have to do other thing that we don't need,because we only wan't that the government can tell us that we can trust in you and with ours help everybody have the hope in you that the futura that is coming is better than this.

For be honest I wan't to know you for put in order the points that each other have to know and share for the welfare of the state,basically we only have to explain what thing is wrong for example , the elections for the presidents,vice presidents and senators in the country and each other of the states and places on it.

The smallest states in the country can be not used like a thing or somethin like that because although the government says that we are in a samll state we have straights and that straights says that we can be free in the limits that we have.

thank you for your help
