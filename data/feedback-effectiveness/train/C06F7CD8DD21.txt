Most people are with the fact that we vote for Electoral College but unfortuntley , im not. I am in favor to change to Election by popular vote for the President of the United States. voting for Electoral College dosent make sense and its completly unfair to the people voting and their is a certainty of outcome..The reason why i am against the Electoral College Vote Is cause we think were voting for the president , when were not and its confusing and it dosent make sense.

For example , In the article " Does the Electoral College Work?" source 1 ,pharagrapgh 15 , it states that "Electoral College method is not democratic in a modern sense,"when the people vote , their voting for a slate of electors. So when we vote , its actually were voting for the electors who get to vote for the president , not the people and its really unfair .Each party selects a slatetrusted to vote for the partys nominee.

In addition to my previous point , the second reason why i am against the Electoral College Vote is because its not for to the people who are voting for it .As it states in pharagraph 3 , because of the winner-take all system in each state, candidates dont spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning in. For example , "During the 2000 campaign , seventeen states didnt see the candidates at all, including Rhode Island and South Carolina, and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didnt get to see a single campaign ad."

A dispute over the outcome of Electoral College Vote is possible- it happened in 2000- but its less likely than a dispute over the popular vote. in pharagrapgh 18, it states that the reason is that the winning candidates share of the Electoral Collge is invariably exceeds his share of the popular vote.

To conclude , I am against the Electoral College vote because its unfair, confusing and makes no sense ." Its hard to say this, but Bob Dole was right: Abolish the Electoral College!    Â
