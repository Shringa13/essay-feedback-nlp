Dear TEACHER_NAME,

Do you have a cell phone? It is nice to have, isn't it? You can do so many things with your cell phone like getting on the internet, getting in touch with friends, or keeping track of stuff. Well all these things could help during school. I'm not saying you should let us have it out during class, but in between class periods or during lunch. It would be a big help to us and you. By that I mean our education.

If you allowed us to take our phones out in between classes, we cold swiftly study for a quiz or exam we had in an upcoming period. This would help you in our school test score rating overall.

When we are in school for so long, we students tend to get bored and so we start talking then the teacher gets mad because we are to loud or we are talking while he/she is talking. A way to prevent that is to let us have our phones out during lunch so we can talk to our friends. You might say we get to talk to our friends all the time. I'm talking about the people we don't sit with at lunch cause ya'll don't let us sit any where we want. So we could text or talk to the people across the lunch room.

In our phones we have note pads, calendars, calculators, and other stuff we could use for school. we could keep up with notes taken in class or set an alarm for a day we have test.

I cant say we would not take advantage of this priviledge cause some people will.
