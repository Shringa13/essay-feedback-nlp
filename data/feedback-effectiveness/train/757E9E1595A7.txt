Dear principal,

I am writing to you today because of the issue of community service, it has become apparent to me that some kids are not on board with the idea of it and think its to much work for to little pay-out. How-ever I do not agree with them, the kids that say these things are the slackers they are board at school don't do their home work get bad grades and so-on, but community service is a good thing to do it helps other people and you get good karma for it. I do think that kids should be able to chose how much they do with a minimum amount of 3 hours. This would let the kids who challenge themselves continue to do so, and let the slackers become more used to the idea of work. Now i' m not saying that there isn't a little bit of slacker in every one but to be successful in the job market these day you want to be a hard working individual who doesn't mind doing something for others. Community service will get the idea of that in their head and hopefully send them on the right path through life.

sincerely your friend,
