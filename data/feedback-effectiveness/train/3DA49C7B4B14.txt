I do not agree with technology to read students emotional expressions should be used because it is just a waste of money. I honestly believe that teachers or former students should know when someone is upset angry or happy. I mean it would be irrelavent for a school to spend thouasands of dollars to know when someone is upset. Teachers should be able to see if their own students would be upset.

Schools could spend the money on more important things like for textbooks gym equipment sports classrooms or even build another part to the school not some emotion detector. But hey it is 2018 anything could happen. In paragraph 5 it states "In fact, we humans perform this same impressive "calculation" every day. For instance, you can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face."

DR. Huang predicts. "Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor." How could that even work.
