Why should the people of the united states vote if the electoral votes are the onlt ones that count? I feel it should be up to the people of the united states not all up to the electors. Even though most people know the people are actullay voting for the slate of electors when i feel we as the people of the united states that are votes should count we shouldnt have to depend on someone else.

Even though if the electors tie and then the peoples votes count it would be fair but we be able to fight for are country  at the age eighteen and be able to  vote but still not count is unfair because that would then be the boss of are country and are troops. Also they can leave us to fight over seas and defend are country but we have electors who stay in th u. s all there life and get to chose who run the untied states.

Also, it sates the electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational. It should not be are votes through another person we dont know. For an example that would be like giving a stranger three-thousand dollors and telling it to mail it to one of your family members its a fifty-fifty chance its going to actully get to them.

I just feel that are votes should matter more then electoral votes we get harmed by what ever the president does not any of the electorals. Most of the people now days dont even get into the elections for that reason that they dont  even matter. Plus that was the old way of doing the presidency but now were in 2014 it should change cause it only will effect the people of the united states.
