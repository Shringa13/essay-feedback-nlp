I think we can keep it, But improve it. Like some people do not want to just vote for a slate they want to vote for a president. How about making that happen that's a easy one. Lets look at some of the other side why are they against it. Remember what happen in the 2000 fiasco election, so much stuff went wrong with that one. How about what happened in 1960 in louisianna, when nearly succeed in replacing the democratic electors with new ones who oppose for John F. Kennedy a vote for Kennedy would never actually got that vote.

What if that happens again? Thats a hard one we can improve the stuff like vote on a piece of paper and put it in this huge box and mail that huge box to someone who can talley up the votes so he can get them or something like that. how can we improve the system in a way everybody can join like a website or a likely matter. The president votes only need 29 electoral votes to win. Why not everybody votes not electoral votes.

It can be argued that the Electoral college method of selecting the president may turn off potential voters for candidate who has no hope of carrying thier state Democrats in texas, for example or Republicans in California. The aviods the problem of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of votes and cast. What if we do it like we did it back then wouldn't that be easier then doing it the hard way. instead of having a no region have everybody vote.

Would you include the others since they might feel disenfranchised I know I would, is there no regard for the other states. Is there appeal for a unlikely to be a successfui president. The winner-take-all program how is that working? It is form on a method of awarding electoral votes induces the candidates. For Example in 2012 election to focus thier campaign efforts on the toss-up states. If you can change it how would you and why?
