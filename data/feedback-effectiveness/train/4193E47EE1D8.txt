I believe that performing community service would be a great idea. Why ? Because it can one show responsibility to the kids by showing up for there job is asked to be done when you are required to do so.

Next reason why is because your friends , they want to say forget about that and come hangout but while you are with your friends you can get into trouble or do things you are not suppose to do. Also , community service would be a good idea because it can also show kids how to treat the environment with respect , for example no fighting , talking to others with disrespect. Another reason why community service would be an great idea , because you can show other kids that are younger then you some responsibility and leadership , for an example if you are doing community service and other kids laugh because its hours of work , well while your doing community service those kids can be getting into trouble for the stupidest reasons. Lastly , community service can be another way to be safe and peaceful in your neighborhood. So i think that community service is a great idea for our young teens to perform .
