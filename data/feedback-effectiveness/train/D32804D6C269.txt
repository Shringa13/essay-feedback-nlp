Twenty-five years ago NASA had found something on thr planet Mars. Many people for twenty-five years have wondered if the "Unmasking the Face on Mars' was really made by aliens and if could be a accient artifact left behind by aliens. "The Unmasking the Face on Mars" had probably lead lots of people to thinking that their could be a really big chance of aliens being real. Ever since the face on Mars was discoverd lots of people thought that their really could be alien life it could be just a natural piece of landform on the planet Mars. If you look closley at the 1976 picture its a low quality picture since its from 1976 than twenty-three years later in 1998 it was taken again lots of people who had seen it were not sastisfed it was a winter april in 1998 it was also a cloudy time of year on Mars. Even though the cameras took the picture ten times sharper it had been really cloudy so you could barley see the picture to have real proof if it was created by aliens. Later in 2001 they had gave it a other shot making it the most recent. The 2001 picture had still been some what the same as the 1976 picture. To me its just a normal natural landform that was created itself by the planet. lots of things on earth look like other things it is just the way the landfrom is created into.
