Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I have an idea concerning community service.

You probably are considering to make everyone to do community service and I'm on the same track.

In my sight community service is essential.

Others may not have the time to do something they need done and we can help.

It is also much wiser to help someone in need rather than students at home playing video games or watching television.

Service helps you feel good inside and have better self esteem and may also help you physically.

There are many people around us that don't have the time to get things done that are very important.

Some single parents don't have time to work, do household jobs, and take care of their kids everyday.

We may not be able to help with their work but we certainly are able to help them with household things.

They would appreciate it and it will help them to feel more relaxed.

Instead of a mesmerized feeling that you get watching television or playing video games, you will have a happy and peaceful feeling inside.

That is much more rewarding.

Community service may also help you physically.

Hard work of cleaning or moving things is a way to be active.

The constant effort that you don't realize may be helping your strength and cardio.

Since we have an overweight problem in America it would actually help if we did more service.

Many people now days don't have very high self esteem.

When you do service for someone else they will probably thank you over and over and say how wonderful you are.

It might actually make you think twice about yourself and try harder because you know someone cares.

I think community service is very important for students to do because it helps other people, it helps you to become physically active, and it may raise your self esteem.

Even though people grumble about doing service it is really important that they do it.

In the end they will be glad they had the chance to do service for some other than themselves.
