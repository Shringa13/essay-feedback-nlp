Principal

This is my opinion of your future change in the school activities. I'm not in favor in this change, if the students are good players, the principal have to let they play at least they have a grade C average, but if the students don't have a good grade, like F or D, the principal have to tell they that they can't play anymore, till they make a good grade.

This change can do a good change because the students that play a sport or if they are in the band, and if they care more in the activity that they play, maybe that can be distorting the student, that can be the reason of why they don't have good grades, so the students what the students have to study at the same with their sport or other activity, and be good with both. Maybe the students are better in their activity because sometimes we have more fun, and because we like to be in more movement. I have to tell that the idea of tell us about this cange and for give us the opportunity to let us tell you, our opinion is good.
