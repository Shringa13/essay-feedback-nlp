We do not think that the face was created by aliens. Although we do belive that it is just a natural landform that happens to look like a face. The way that the shadown is shown on this mesa makes it look like a face. There is really no possible way that the face was created by aliens because, so far we have recorded no life or any unusual movement on mars so we do not think it was created by aliens. The face is not a actual face and it is just a natural landform.

People think that it looks like a face and I cant not argue with that but I do know that it was not made by aliens. If it was made by aliens how would they know what a face even looks like, because I do not think that a alien has ever seen a human face before and therefore how would they know what a human face looks like.
