To the principle of this school

I read your policy's on the internet so i am going to respond in my best opinion. I think if you don't let students have phones in school, then their be no point of having rules. yes i know that students text during classes but their are kids what can you do. But if you let them have phones and use them during free time. Then the kids will call and text each other on the whole school. Then that will be bad, and they will still don't have any education and will not pass their classes. So my guess is to not have cell phones at all or their will fail at school and in life.

but if you let them have phones the you will be the most popular and cool principle of all time. But if you don't then they will hate you for ever and do bad stuff to you. So what do you chouse popularity or the education for the kids. But my decision is no cell phones

Best of lucked just a person
