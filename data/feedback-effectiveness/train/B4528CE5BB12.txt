I believe that we shouldn't change the Electoral College "winner takes all" system. It has been working well for the past couple of presidents. Yes, it might be unfair for thoses who are wanting to be electors and can't because the person they are running for lost but the ones who did win are doing what they believe is right. Just because of one big out break in 2000 doesn't mean the system will fail again. It will gradually progress trough out time and soon it won't ever fail again. You just never know unless you let it continue until it doesn't work any longer and when it does you find a new, better system that will work for decades. In 2000 people might have switched their votes because they thought that person desirved it not the other guy. The system of "winner takes all" hasn't failed since 2000. It works so why get rid of it. If it were to fail multiple times then yes get rid of it and find something new but it hasn't.
