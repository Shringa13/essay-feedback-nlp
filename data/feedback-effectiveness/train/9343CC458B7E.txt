Dear Principal,

I think that community service is a great thing to do, but should not be required. Some people just aren't that type of people, while others are.

You can't force people into something that they don't want to do.

Some people might do service with a little motivation.

There are many ways you could motivate people to do something, but you need to wonder if whatever you are doing to motivate the people is worth the community service.

You can try to force the people into doing the community service.

It probably won't work for a couple reasons.

Everybody has their own agency or individuality to do whatever they want.

Some people might choose to but most people at this middle school age put themselves before others.

They just aren't kind enough to put others before themselves.

Most people as they get older become more stubborn.

Once they decide that they don't want to sacrifice themselves for others, it is going to be hard to change their minds.

In conclusion, community service is a great thing to do, but not many people are willing to sacrifice themselves for others.

It is hard to change the minds of the stubborn people.

Do what you want, but do you think all the resistance will be worth it?

If it is, then do it.

But you could make the resistance less by awarding those who do it.

Sincerely,
