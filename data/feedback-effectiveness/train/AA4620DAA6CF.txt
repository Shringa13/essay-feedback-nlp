I PROPER_NAME think that the electoral college should be Abolished . How would you feel if you were running for President and only 1 party got to pick the winner ? That just seems unfair and Unorganized to me . For someone to have to go through an entie process just to pick President , is way more far then what it could be . I dont thnk its okay for State Legislatures to have a say-so in who should be President should be because for them to try to pick it for themself with out the help of "The People" which is who really matters.

"The People" should have just as much an say-so in who the President and Vise president should be .Well they do but i dont think the State Partie should have anything to do with the votes. For 1 the collage or process its' self is Unnessary jst for someone to cast a vote , when they could really check who they want to vote for on a peice of paper or something . Sure that would take alot of time just to count but i think thats far more organized than for everyone to go through a process on a computer or something . According to the text the Electral College process consists of the selection of the electors .... Thats too much voting going on for no reason . Everyone is entilted to their own opinion and it should be heard , because every little vote counts. I remember when i was in Elementary school nd when election time came around they took the students in the library to vote ; even though we were not old enough to vote i can garentee the votes that we casted made a difference even if it was just by 1 vote . But as i think abut it , the president is not just for the benifit of the Congress and the State Legslatures , He/She is for the benifit of EVERYONE . i think that the State Parties wants to have a say-so in the votes just so they can feel important .
