The Electoral College is a compromise between the election of the President by electoral votes. This has been around for as long as I can remember. It plays a very big part in our government.Â  Some people want to get rid of it. Others don't. Do you think we should keep the it?

The Electoral College balances out the amount of popular votes. If both candidates are tied, we turn to the state electors. The candidate that has the biggest amount of electoral votes wins. One candidate can have more popular votes and very few electoral votes. The popular votes are just for the state electors to decide which they are going to pick. In the end it all goes down to them, The Electoral College,

On the other hand, some people don't like this idea. The electors are sometimes depend on the state. Other times the state conventions, the presidential candidates, and sometimes the sate party's central committee. Voters think it's unfair. They spend a bunch of time voting for who THEY want, but in the end it comes down to the electors. So in reality it doesn't even matter who the voters choose. They really just choose a slate of electors, who then elect the president,

I think we should get rid of The Electoral College. It's not fair to the people. We waste all our time to vote on a president we want, to only end up voting for the electors. I understand that it does have its good affects, but it just feels like we don't even matter. Where's the freedom?

Some people think we should keep the Electoral College. Others don't. It has it's good things. It has it's bad. I personally feel like we should just get rid of it. What do you think we should do?
