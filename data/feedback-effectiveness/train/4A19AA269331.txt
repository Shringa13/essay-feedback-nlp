Dear senator i think that we should cape the electoral college process because, if it is not broken don't fix it. Also this process is a part of our founding fathers history it was established to compromise between election of the president. Thats way we should cape the electoral college process.

The electoral college has 538 electors but the president needs to have 270 electoral votes to become the president. The 23 amendment of the contitution allows columbia 3 electors and treated like a state for purpose of the electoral college. When you vote for your candidate you are actually voting for your candidates electors. Every candidate running for president in your state has his or her own goup of electors. Some states have a winner take all system, which gives all the electors a award to the winning presidential candidate.

After the presidential election the governor prepares a "certificate of ascertainment" listing the candidates who ran for president. The certificate of ascertainment declares the winning presidential candidate in my state will represent your state at the meeting of electors. Abolishing the electoral college no said Bob Dole and Jimmy Carter they agreed. They are not alone according to a Gallup poll in 2000 taken after Al Gore thanks to the quirks of the electoral college won the popular vote but lost the presidency over 60% of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now.

The electoral college avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast. There is pressure for running off election when no candidate wins a majority of the votes cast that pressure which would complicate the presidential election process is reduced by the electoral college which produces a clear winner.
