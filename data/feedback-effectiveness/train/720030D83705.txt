I think that having electorals college is a great idea for our counries because they also help the voters with thier votes also because all the other people have candidate which makess it easy for electors who democrafts in texas because they know this will not have any effect in them otherwise they wouldnt vote but the electors need good reasons why the voters should vote for them so you would need to have specific facts and good source and why would you make a great president or why you think your better than the other elector all this questions and more you have to persuade them in any possible way but with truth no lies like if you promise the world for better oppportunities you have to prove to them youre actually willing to do this and be part of thier lives by changing the way they live not only that but you have to accomplish your goals . At the end whoever has more votes is the winner the people who voted for you are especting the best out of you bascally thier putting all thier trust in you, someone they have no clue who you are and why are the exact reason your thier or what your goals are,
