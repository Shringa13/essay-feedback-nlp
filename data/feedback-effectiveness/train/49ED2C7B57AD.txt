In this essay, I will be showing how the face on Mars is just a plain everyday landform.

In 1976, a picture was taken by the satellite Viking 1. The picture on Mars was found to be what looked like the face of an Egyptian god. The pictures taken were blurry but showed to actually be a face indicating there was life on Mars sometime in the past or even here in the present. NASA kept studying this mask for years to come. A few years later, another satellite took pictures about 10 times sharper and clearer. But in this picture, the so called mask just looked like a normal everyday landform. The media was not happy with this picture. But this picture did show proof that there was just a landform just like on Earth, that was nothing special. Even one of NASA's global surveyor said that there are landforms on Mars just like on Earth.

In conclusion, the landform on Mars was just a simple regular crater that looked like a face in a poor quality, blurry picture.
