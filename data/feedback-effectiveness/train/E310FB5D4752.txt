Dear State Senator you guys should consider abolishing the electoral college and keep the popular votes for president of united states. The electoral college is unfair , outdated and also irrational. The Electoral college is unfair because the winner take all all system in each state.

The electoral college was established by the founding fathers in the constitution as a compromise etween the election of votes. The votes consist of about 538 electors. About 270 elector votes is required for president. Its not fair because other people votes dont count if 270 votes count for president election. The Electoral college is regarded because the selecting of the president should be declared by the president who which recieves the most vote

Why i think changing the election to the president with the most votes will help because its gives the president more opportunity or chance to have a fair election. Its not fair that alot of people vote and only about half of their vote counts.

In Conclusion I Think Changing the election to the one with the most votes will be more fair. They should also abolish the electoral votes because its unfair , outdated , and irrational for 538 people to votes and only 270 votes count toward the election on order for the president to.
