My claim to do studying on Venus is saying no I think spending so much time and money on something that has been tempted to do multiple times and failed is wasteful. Because we have tried on numerous accaions and have got just a few hours with a little bit of information it is not worth it. Researchers know that they only get a super small time to only see a little bit of a huge planet.

Knowing that Venus is a whole planet the size of earth and only getting to see just a tiny bit of it is like starting at one side of the United States and then driving only a few hours to see how far you get, If you are trying to go all the way around the world to get back to the same spot but only have a few hours to do so, you don't cover much of anything to have any real say of how the world looks in different areas if you haven't seen it all yet.

In conclusion to the challenge of Venus I say it is a time waster and we will not be able to see the whole planet of Venus with only a few hours once every few decades.
