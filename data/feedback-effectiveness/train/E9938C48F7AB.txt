Dear,

State Senator

I think that we should keep this electoral college because the founding fathers established it in the constitution as a compromise between election of the president by a vote in congress and election of the president by a popular vote of qualified citizens.

On the other hand it would be way easier for people to vote. Also a majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the president. your states entitled allotment of electors equals the number of members in its congressional delegation. Plus, each candidate running for president in your state has his or her own group of electors. So this would be perfect for everyone to vote.

After the presidential election, your governor prepares a ' certificate of Ascertainment' listing all of the candidates who ran for president in your state along with the names of their respective electors. The certificate of Ascertainment also declares the winning presidential candidate in your state and shows which electors will represent your state at the meeting of theelectors in december of the election year. Your states certificates of Ascertainments are sent to the congress and the national Archives as part of the offical records of the presidential election.

Also, most States have a 'winner-take-all' system that awards all the electors to the winning presidential candidate. however, maine and Nebraska each have a variation of 'proportional representation'.

Under the 23rd Amendment of the constitution, the District of columbia is allocated 3 electors and treated like a state for purposes of the Electoral college. For this reason, in the following discussion, the word 'state' also refers to the district of columbia.

so i really do think that we should keep this it would be a really good thing to keep.

but this is why i think that we should keep it.
