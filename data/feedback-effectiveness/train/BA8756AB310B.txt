Dear principal,

Community service is a great thing to do for the environment. This assignment for others to do community service will help out our community alot thanks to your gratitude. I know for a fact that once every student does community service that our community will be showing a great example for other students at other schools. This will help others relize how important the environment is these days and how bad it is now. Students will begin to relize that life isn't all about games and electronic devices. Its about the hard work in life that gets your through the bad and good. And that you need to show respect for the environment and others around you.

People will start beginning to show an bit more patients in life once they know that the community is a safe and healthy place. Wouldn't you want to people to clean up after themselves. Instead of you doing it for them. People have been littering for years and it is now time for people to take responsibility for there actions. We need to show them that doing a little work for the community can make a big difference in our world that we live in today. It is time for people to fix there mistakes and admit what they have done wrong.

I hope that you consider my letter as a letter of hope and a chance for something new. So do what is right and allow people to relize that when you do something for the community it will do something back for you. Which would be a nice, free, cleansed world that is safe for others to live in and you no longer have to worry about the safety of the environment.

Sincerely,

Student Book
