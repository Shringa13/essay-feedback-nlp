I thinkl that you should keep electoral college because qualified citizens chose it obvisliy. But besides that reason you should have it's a easy compromise to vote. It helps you choose your state's electors when you vote for president because you are actullay voting for your candidates electors. Under the system of electoral college voters vote not for presdint ,but for a slate of electors instead. It could help us undersatnd voting for our electors if you keep electoral voting. Even though some say that this was the 2000 fisaco was the biggest election crisis in a century. The system could of had worse. I think it helps with voting more than anything else instead of the online voting for the slate electors.

Some also so it should be abloished and that it's unfair and very irrantional, it has helped more than do any damage to any other type of voting like that tabs we once used to vote for everything. We should keep it because of its certanity of outcome because it helps when there is a tie on voting. "Swing States" are anthor reason because of the winner takes all method we sawin 2012's election to focus their campaign efforts on the  toss up states ,it help us out because at the end of paragraph 20 it says the most thoughful voters should be the ones to decide the election with electoral college.  It does also big states electoral college restores some of the weigth in the political balance that large states lose by virtue.

It does also help with run-off elections it helps avoid the problem of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast. It says that it may turn off voters for a candidate who has no hopes of carrrying their state. Those are my reasons why you shouldn't  get rid of electoral voting hopfully you will condsier it.
