Technology To Read Emotions

In this article they share about the Facial Acting Coding System. They ask us if we agree with it or not. My answer would be yes, I think there is nothing wrong with it. My personal opinon is it is actually kind of cool. This can really help people out knowing others emotions.

The reason I think there isn't anything wrong with this is because I dont see its harming anything. When I said it could help people I was refering to when they said that it can show when someone is bored and that the teacher could try to make it less boring. If I was a teacher or I wondered hiow someone is I9 would want to use this.

Another reason this is helpful is that it can detect when someone is feeling down or mad or something else. When someone sees what it detected they can see if the student needs someone to talk to or help. When a teacher uses this and they see that the student is bored and not focus they could try to make it fun or do something at the moment and make the focus and awake.

This system can be compareded to peoples thoughts on what some are feeling. There are some people that can almost do the same as this. But this system can do it pretty fast and tell yus exactly everything. They say when you do this you move your muscles and whatever ones you usae can make you happy. Which I think is cool and smart.

In conclusion I totally agree with this. Almost everything I put is my feeling on this Facial Action Coding System. Overall I can say it can really help some people out and that it is very smart. This is a thing they could use in an everyday thing. It could aso correct how people feel about teachers lessons or just anything like that.
