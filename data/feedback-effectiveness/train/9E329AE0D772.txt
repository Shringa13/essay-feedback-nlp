I believe that using this in a classroom will be valuable. However, this could also be a bad idea. It states in the text that your freontailis pars lateralis muscle (above your eyes) raises your eyebrows when you're surprised. First of all, It is good to know that, because looking at old photographs taken you can see if the person is happy or not. Second of all, the computer can tell if a student is bored, confused, sad, and happy. Which is very good for the teacher. If a student were to be confused on something that they were learning, and did not want to ask in front of the class, it would show the teacher that they need to know more about the subject that they are struggling with. Finally, It is very inspiring how the computer can tell when your actually being serious with your facial expressions, and when you are not. I believe that all schools should try these. This will be the future, and will be good when used in classrooms.
