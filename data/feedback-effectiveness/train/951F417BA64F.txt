When it comes to the technology that reads students emotions I think its a great idea of having it in classrooms. Although some may ask, why dont you just ask us how we feel in this class? Others might just nit want to answer the question. So it would be easier to just get your answer from a mechine that gives you the answer you want.

There are many advantages to this technology when it come to reading other emotions. When using this device you could find out if many students are interested in the activity the teacher is talking about. You could also find out if the are just bored to death that they just want to get up and leave.

This technololgy could help with many things in the future by getting rid of all the non-fun things that happen in classroom. If this technology was in high schools I think the way teachers teach thing now days would be way better. For example, when the author put the mini lesson about moving you face in different emothions that was a good lesson. Just from that I learn that just moving your face around in different emotion could make you feel like the face you just made.

When it come to technology about your emotions in the classroom i think it would be very useful. Not only will the teachers know if students are interested, they will know if they need to change the way they teach things in class.
