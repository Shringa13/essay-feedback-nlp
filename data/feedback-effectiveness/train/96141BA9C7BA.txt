For years, people have been telling others that the natural landform on Mars is actually a face created by aliens. I as a scientist believe that it is also a landform coinencidently in the shape of a face. There are multiple reasons why I and many other scientists feel this way.

We have tried multiple times to photograph this landform and have succeeded. It appears to majority of us, that it is not more than a natural landform. We have took many precautions into making sure that it isn't an alien artifact. For example, it's like the man on the moon. It just happened to be there naturally and created itself over time. You are of course entitled to your own opinion, but that doesn't make it a fact.

In conclusion to this theory, it is not more than just a theory. We are not hiding anything from the world. Something like this I'm sure we'd be more than happy to share with the rest of the world in our amzing findings. We could be wrong, that is so. But, we're pretty positive it's just a landmass.
