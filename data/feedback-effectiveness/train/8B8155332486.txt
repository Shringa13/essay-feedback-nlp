Seeking mutiplle opinions is a great idea for many people.

One reason why is because some things could be bad and nobady wants that and, there could be people who has the right information.

Looking for people with the best advice is the good part, thats why some people look for more people with advice, to see who has the best advice.

Not alot of people will have good advice for what you're looking for but sometimes could be good intel on some other things you'd probably need to know like life standards, what to eat so you can get better, and what can make you better.

Getting advice from mutiple people is a really good idea because not everyone is going to give you all information because their either going to forget about it, not want to say, or don't want to talk about it all the way.

The more the advice the person gives you the better, the most advice is the advice that will teach you more about what you need to know.
