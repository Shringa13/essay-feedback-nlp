Dear, Principal I think students at our school should be required to do community service. There are many reasons they should do community service. One of the reasons is that all the students should be involved in the community. Another reason is so that instead of the students going out and doing drugs and hurting the community they could help the community.

The only reason that people get bored in school is because they don't think that they are helping there future in school because they don't feel involved. But if they are required to do community service they would feel involved and it would help there future.

If the students volunteered at a elementary school it won't just help the volunteer it would also help the elementary student. If we help the elementary student it would not just help his future but ours to.

Here at our school it would be great to have to require community service it wont just help us but it would also help our future. Please look into having our students require community service. Thank you.

Sincerely, STUDENT_NAME
