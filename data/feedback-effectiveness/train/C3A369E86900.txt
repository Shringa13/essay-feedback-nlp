My opinion when people ask for advice is they might want help, a good understanding, to see what others are thinking, or to see a situation in somebody's point of view. Most of the time, when you talk to multiple people you most likely really want an answer to something. Thats why most people go ask others so they can find what cab be the best answer and what makes the most sense.

Why seeking for opinions could be better? It could be better because the answer that the person is giving could be the answer they're looking for. Seeking for opinions is actually a good idea sometimes, you get to know what other people are thinking or others point of view of the situation, say if your close friend is in a different mind set as you and he/she is confused with what is going on or dont understand yall can help each other to understand and get to know whats going on in the situation and how to get a good answer and result.
