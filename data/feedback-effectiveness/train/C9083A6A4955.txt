Dear Principle,

I am a student at our school and I have some thoughts on the polices that you and the school administrations will be imposing over the next weeks. It is my belief that it would be in the best interest of all the students and teachers if no cell phones where allowed during school hours under normal circumstances. I think this is the correct option because, while at school a student's mind should be on the work he or she has been assigned and the job of keeping his/her grades up. Cellular devices are a distraction from school work and assignments they keep a student occupied with social activities and interaction rather then the grades and assignments that the student has been assigned. Also a cell phone is not only a distraction for students but a hazard. Imagine if you will how hard it is carrying all your books and other school related items without distraction then amagin your cell phone going off in your pocket, of course you answer it but while pulling the phone from your pocket you trip and fall. it is much easer to fall and drop books or food while talking on a cell phone.

There is however one exception to the general rule of no cell phones. that is in the case of an emergency, such as a fire or a hostage situation. Since these are risks that must be taken into account. I propose a compromise between the two extremes. Student should be allowed to keep there phones on their person as long as they are turned off at all times during a regular school day. this then creates the problem of students texting during school hours and class so I propose that students who are caught texting or using the cell phone during school our not in the case of an emergency should have there phones took away for a set amount of time. much like if a student does something wrong he/she is punished with a certain amount of time.

I thank you for taking the time to listen to my thoughts,

Sincerely, STUDENT_NAME
