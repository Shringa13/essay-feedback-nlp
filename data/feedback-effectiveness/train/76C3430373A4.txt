Venus the evening star since its the brightest point of light in the night sky. Humans have sent numerous spacecraft to land on this cloud-draped world and each missiion was unmanned since no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours and nvere touched venus in more than tree decades. The thick atmosphere is almost 97 percent carbon dioxide and the clouds are even more challenging since their is highly corrosive sulfuric acid in venus's atmosphere and on the planet surface temperatures average is over 800 degrees fahrenheit and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than we experience on earth and the environment would crush even a submarine. Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported forms of life and has familiar features suah as valleys, mountains, and craters and In conclusion if we could possibly bulid something to survive venus we could find some amazing things like if it ever ahad water and find maybe remains of past forms of life.
