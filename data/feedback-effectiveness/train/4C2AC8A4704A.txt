I will be telling you about a story called "A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves." I think it is a good story. In the story it tells about a boy who signs up with his friend to be in a cattle boat job in the passage it said " The UNRRA hired "Seagoing Cowboys to take care of cows,horses,mules,and more over seas. Luke and Don signed up for the job." Luke got to go all around the earth and deliver cattle. Lukes job on the boat was to check the cattle every hour.

Luke got to go all around the world and see amazing places they had allot of free time so they visited many places. Luke visited greece luke got to see the Acropolis. They saw China,Europe,Italy,and more. Luke got to stay in these places and got to see many things. Luke liked the job working as cattle delivers.

In conclusion Luke had allot of fun and Luke got to see allot of things in other countrys. I think it was a good story. At the end of the story Luke says "I'm grateful for the opprotunity. It mad me aware of people in other countrys." I hope that you saw Lukes point of view and it convinced you to be in the Seagoing Coyboy in the program.
