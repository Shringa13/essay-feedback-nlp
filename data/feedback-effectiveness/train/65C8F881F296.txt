A New School Policy

This idea of not letting students participate in sports or other activities unless they have a grade B average is just bologna. Every students deserves the right to have a fun time with friends, get excersize, and be healthy by participating in a sport or other activity at school.

Athletic ability should not be based on smarts, because a person who is a fantastic athlete could be getting all C' s in their classes. Many kids only enjoy playing sports or being in school activities like school dances, fundraises, field trips, etc. Taking away these rights to the children with grade C averages and above is just plain cruel.

In my opinion every student deserves the right to be involved in school activities as long as they keep an above grade D average. Many students have a grade C average, but that is not their fault if that is the only grade they are able to get. If a student who doesn't have a grade B average wants to play a sport or join in an activity at school and enjoy it, wont be able to because of one class that is bringing their grade down.

If students have a grade C average or below, the school's job should be to help this student in getting better grades and keeping those grades. To strip away the students activities could leave them angry, mad, and wanting to rebel. Let's keep the school policy at a grade C average and keep everyone happy.
