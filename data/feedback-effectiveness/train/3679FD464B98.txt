Mona Lisa is a famous painting by Leonardo da Vinci. There is many theories of Mona Lisa being sad, or feeling many other emontion but no body knows the truth but Da Vinci.

Based on the text evidence,

" Making Mona Liza Smile,"

a new software called Facial Action Coding System has been developed to try infenitfing Mona Lisa's facial expressions. She could have up to six different basic emontions.

First of all, Mona Lisa overall expressions use she is 83% happy.

Based on this article, " the software can even identify mixed emotions (as in da Vinci's masterpiece). each expression is compared against neutral face (showing no emotion)." This is saying that even that she shows no expressions, she is certainly happy but might be having mix feelings as well.

Another reason Mona Lisa can be feeling disgusted, fearful, or even angry but yet she's very mysterious. In the text it says, " most of us would have trouble actually describing each facial trait that conveys happy, worried, etc."

If humans have trouble figuring out if something is feeling happy or sad, how can a software be able to do such thing.

The software FACS is interesting becuase it's able to know your emotions with any movement you do. For example, in the text it says, " even though individuals often show varying degress of expressions. Using a video imagery, the new emotion-recognition software tracks thsee facial movements." If a gental move can determine an emotion, this software will have a challenge on finding out Mona Lisa's emotions because it's just a painting.

Therefore, Mona Lisa will be mysterious until the software identifies her emotions. Mona Lisa is and will always be a unique peice of art.
