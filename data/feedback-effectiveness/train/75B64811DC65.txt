First off I want to let you know that Electoral College is a process and not a place. It was established by the founding fathers. Process consists of the selection of the electors, the metings of the electors where they vote for president and Vice President. The electoral college consists of 538 electors and the majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the president. The amount of members in its congressional delegation, "one for each member in the House of Representatives plus two of your Senators". The candidate that's running for president in your state has it's own group of electors. They're generally chosen by the candidate's political party but that state law varys on how the electors are selected and what their responsibilities are. One of the best things about the Electoral College is that it's widely regarded as an anachronism and a non-democratic method of the selecting of a president that ought to be overruled by declaring the candidate who receives the most popular votes wins. it also requires a president candidate to have transregional appeal. Always remember "voters in presidential elections are people who want to express a political preference rather than people who think that a single vote may decide an election.
