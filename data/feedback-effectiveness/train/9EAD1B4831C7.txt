Mona Lisa face expressions are different than others face's, depending on how the person look with no smile, no anger, and no saddness. The emotional communication is nonverbal, showing the more emotion there is though our face's. Smile' are all differnet depending if it's a real one or a forced one. Faces don't lie, Smiling isn't being truthful they said. Willing to put on a face, it usually works most of the time, but not only to expresses emotion, it's tells us how they are feeling today or what they are going though.

When actors fake a smile or a frown they don't feel it really, they just make the face to prove or hide what they are feeling or showing. They act the show and give what's on the paper and have the same movement that we humans have to use when we express how we feel.

We have six basic emotions. Happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and there is sadness. They associated with each of our characteristics movements of the facial muscules. "The facial expressions for each emotion are universal." We have some software tracks on these facial movement that our brain follows, it can find out you're mix emotion and expression by you're neutral face. This not means what you can really see without the tech and just see the real feeling and the real smile or their sadness. This Facial Action Coding System is identifing the moment of the face right that minute, but not what they are feeling right after or before.

What I'm tryig to say is that our computers are blind and won't see what's really happening, our faces can lie to computers but not to people who know's what they been though and can see in other human their self. You got to see it deep into their eyes and smile if they are really happy or just really sad within their ife. It's different how the Da Vinci code is, with converting their specific emotoin with the new electronic code.
