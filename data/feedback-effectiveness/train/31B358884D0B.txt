The National Aeronautics and Space Administration has one particularly compelling idea for sending humans to study Venus. NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditiond on the surface of Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray. If you image blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or more miles above the roiling Venusian landscap, it would be a shocker. Temperatures would still be tasty at around 170 degrees Fahrenheit, but the air pressure would ber close to the level of the sea and Earth. I think the autors statement on this is that when the temperature drops its very hard to communitcate with people going up there, but when it cools down its better for them. The Earth and Beyond it should not be limited by dangers and douts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation.

There devices were the first envisioned in the 1800s an playedan important role in the 1940's during World War ll. The thoughts of computers in those days did caulations for them, which in today's years we know thing about. Many of the reserchers of the NASA is working on other approches to studying Venis. Like some are simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus' surface and have lasted for three weeks in such conditiond. There a lot of projects that there looking back to an old technology called mechanical computers. Using mechanical parts can be made more resistant to pressure, heat, and other forces.
