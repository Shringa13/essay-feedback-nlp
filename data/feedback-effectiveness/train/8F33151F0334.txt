He joined the programe for many reasons to help familys out with yard work and things like that when the husbands and fathes were at war. Also he helped with grocery stores and lots of bisnesses and he helped countrys recover food. He said it was an opertunity of a lift time to do this. He helped a lady at a farm all by her self. He went on a ship to go other places and help and on board he found some time to be him and just have fun. On lukes second trip he served watch men. He was to check on all of the animals and it was rainy out and he sliped and fell down very wet steps he almost slid out of the boat but a lucky peace of meatal beam was there and he stop right before he went out of an open side of the boat. but this put him on medical leave so he couldent work so I bet he was a little upset that he couldent help on the boat or where ever they stoped to help on land. He had fun with table tennis tournements fencing boxing reaidin and whittling the games he played helped pass time on the bout and just relaxe for a wile and have some fun. He said being a seagoing was much more than an adventure for luke boberger. He is greatful for this oppertunity he says and made it more aware to people in other countrys that that had food and nice people to give it to them.
