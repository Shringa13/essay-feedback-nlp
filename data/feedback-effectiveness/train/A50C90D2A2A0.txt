Have you ever thought of being a cowboy then your in luck becase today you can be a seagoing cowboy and see not just cows but unique places in the world and see places in the world that you thought only existed in books and movies.

If you thought that you would be wrong the places in books are sometimes real and sometimes not and if you want to help people and go on a advencher this is the job for you. The perks of this job would be the trip and if a cow dies of old age it is a steak cook out and you can see more animals you thought possible in a bout. The sea is a inportant part of the job and if you are scard of water then this job is not for you.

Now the sites of a seagoing cowboy are absolutely amassing you could see greece and the Parthonon and rome with the romen coloseum and china with it's large 16th cenchery builidings and spain with it's large docks with large sea vesalls and englend and buckinghem palice and the tower of london and big ben and germeny the starting place of the war and home of hitller and berlin. If you like steak and other meat meals then you have to eat somthing different then your favoret meals becase of the cow on the ship the might get a little wored and start to get out of control but dount let a cow stop you from bring a seagoing cow boy and help with the things we need the do to help thoughts in need.

If you dount have patince then this job is not the job for you becase if you have optins that are always fast then go for that and dount get this job becase this job needs alote of patince.

So if you relly want to get this job then you are exepted.
