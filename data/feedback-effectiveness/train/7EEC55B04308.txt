I think the community service is a wonderful idea. The children should know that littering is a bad idea. I'm sure that they would want a clean community and have something nice around them. Some littering can cause bad air quality. That just depends on the litter. Also it's better to have a nice environment. If i had things to do that was not been told, i' d be picking up litter and many things for the community would look nice when people are passing by. Also all students should be required to perform the community service. Also it doesn't take that much time is others are helping. The when everything is cleaned up, that's when you can do anything the children wants. Like for example: play in the dirt, run around, play with the equipments that's around there community, or listen to music and other many playful games. Well that's all i think about how you should require all students to participate in the community service.
