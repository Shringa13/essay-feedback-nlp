Electoral college is a process of electors and a poupular vote is by the people. In this argue it ask which one would i favor, i have read the artical and as i was reading i have seen that i would keep Electoral college. I have three reason. one of them it's easier for us understand how the prosses works. my second reason is some people dont care about who they vote for, and my third reason is the history of Electoral college.

My fist reason is the the way the process work. The process works as a number of electors. The electors are what count more thoes are what count to see who are next president is going to be they are the final vote. The electors get together and talk it out so see who wins the most votes. The number of electors are 538. About 270 electors are for the president. The election for the president is held every four years after the first Monday in november.

My second reason is
