According to the passage using emotions and expression to show how we feel and animated characters using animations and showing facial expressions to express emotions and how they feel towards other things is not a bad idea. If a human gets hurt then the emotion and the expression would be squinting there eyes being loud or holding whatever got hurt. So giving those types of animations and expressions to robots and video game characters would be good because you would not be able to tell what happened to them if they didnt have any emotion of when they got hurt or smiling. When a human is taing a picture and you want to make it look nice they would smile so they would open there mouth and show there teeth making there face wrinkle. They need to put the same emotion and such for animated characters in tv shows and video games. Also you have to use some muscles to smile and to show facial expressions towards everything like jobs,school,and even taking pictures.
