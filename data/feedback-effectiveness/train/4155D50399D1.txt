Dear, TEACHER_NAME,

TEACHER_NAME I Believe that cell phones need to stay at home because in order for students to get a good education they need not to be distracted by devices such as a cell phone, That is why i think Policy 2 is the best one .

Students in this school should have they're phones left at home because on a test day a student forgot to study him/her texts a friend who already had that class ask him/her for the answers, and that right there is cheating. In order for students to get a good education they need to be well aware of the material in each class study for exams, test etc. and so further more if the students are distracted by they're phones the Teacher who is Teaching that class shall take up the students phone and keep it for five days with a policy of five days at the end of five days they must pay fifteen dollars to get it back. Another reason would be if students are not educated enough and they fail the TAKS test your school will be the lowest in education and there for we the supreme independent district will have to fire you from your current position as school principle. "PLEASE READ WITH CAUTION!".

Signed,

STUDENT_NAME
