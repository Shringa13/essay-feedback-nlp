This artical,"The Challenge of Exploring Venus," is the authors way to give ideas on how to help get closer to Venus. the author starts out with how and what Venus looks like. The author also compares Venus to Earth and says "[It's] Often reffered to as Earth's "twin."'

The author's article, "The Challenge of Exploring Venus," has a very good look into why we need to explore and learn more about Venus. The athor even gives ideas/ways for NASA to be able to explore Venus. Examples like "...NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray." This is one of the few ideas that the author gives out.

The whole artical is about how Venus is so like Earth or "Earth's "twin."' This is a good artical to look for if looking up ideas for a essay because it gives facts like "...Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size."

Or facts about the devices that they used in the pass that didn't work like "...simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus's surface..."

To end off on a good term, the author had put in time to let people know that we should think smarter not harder to be able to see closer into what Venus is hiding. The Author says "...Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doughts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation." This meaning not to thing to hard and work with what you got insted of thinking of a way to get all information right away.
