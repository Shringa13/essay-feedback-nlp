Dear Senator,

I think the Electoral Collage is unfair to the citizens of the United States of America. The Electoral collage resembles too much control by the United States government. As said in Source 2: The Indefensible Electoral Collage: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong, "Back in 1960, segregationists in the Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy. This dosnt even sound right does it... This is one example of United States government trying to rail  the presidential elections, and i can asure you that this is not the first time this has been attempted by the government. The U.S Constitution delcares that

ALL

citizens of United States of America have the right to vote. What this looks like is the government trying to vote for us. Another thing that i do not get about the Electoral Collage is why are we voting for the elector instead of just towards the president. I get that they have to monitor the votes but arnt we already using electronic computers to vote... I think voting would go alot smoother if the votes went strait to the presidents through computers instead of having an elector who has a strong personal opinion against one political party who has a chance of twisting the votes around to strongly support the political party that he/she is opinionized towards. This why the Electoral Collage is dangerous. There have been cases of law breaking electors twisting the votes around. It is alot more safe to just let the citizens to just strait up vote. In source 3, It tries to tell you all the possitive things about the Electoral Collage... The possitive things they mention about the Electoral Collage are small compared to the issues with it. The Electoral Collage is outdated and needs to be taken off. It is just unfair now.
