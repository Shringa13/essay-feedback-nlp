"Making Mona Lisa Smile'',the author describes how a new technology called the Facial Action Coding System enables computer to identify human emotions.

The use of this tecgnology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable because not only it helps read kids mind whenthere upset and not happy but it helps you to because you dont have to try in read there mind as a teacher the comouter can automatically tell for you. In that they just wanted to make better ways for humans and computers to communicate. Also that its that good ''i could modify the lesson ,like an effective human instructor.

Can it actually calculate emtions 99% better then any smart software?

"The process begins when the computer constrcutios a 3-D computer model of the face, all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles." Not everyone would wanna feel like getting on a computer checking to see if there happy or not. In not everyone would want to sit in front of a computer sing there moving there head trying to figure out if there ok knowing they already no. It '' we humans can tell if someone happy or if someone sad just by looking at there face'' yes its true, in yes we doo it on a daily so why neeed to have the Facial Action Coding System when we can just keep finishing what we been doing and reading people minds as usally.
