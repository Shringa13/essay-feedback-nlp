Many years ago NASA'S Viking 1 spacecraft was circling around Mars, trying to get any photos of possible landing sites for it's sister ship known as Viking 2. As the spacecraft was taking these photos, they spotted a cohesive head. At first the scientists thought that it was probably just another Martian mesa, but the thing about this one was that it had very unusual shadows that made it look like and Egyptian Pharaoh.

Days later NASA let the picture out for the world to see. The picture went viral within days. This had become one of the most famous talked about things in the world. It appeared in books, magazines, radio talks, shows, etc.

There were very few scientists who believed the Face could've been an alien artifact, but photographing Cydonia became a major priority for NASA. On April 5, 1998, Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the very first time. At this time, Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera team captured a picture of the Face that was very sharp and you could tell what it was.

On April 5, 1998 many excited and anxious web surfers were waiting for the image to show up somewhere. The image did pop up but it wasn't what the web surfers were expecting. Most people were dissapointed when they found out that the picture of the face they had been waiting for, turned out to be just a natural land form.

What I have stated proves that the Face is a natural land form. It may have looked like a face in the blurred picture, but we now know that it was just a landform.
