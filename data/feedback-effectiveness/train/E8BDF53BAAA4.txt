Dear Senator,

In my favor, i bielive that popular vote, for electing the president of United States Of America, is the best choice for election. Every thing is for the people right? Give the people what they want. If majority votes a certain somthing, such as the president, shouldnt the people be able to get what they want, its for for the people right? No one is going to vote for somthing as impotant as this for no good reason. They vote and agree for whatever gives them the best intentions. Why disatisfy the people? Shouldnt they get what they want? I mean its for the people isint it? If so, then popular election it is. Think about it. The whole point of even having a president is to control and keep the United States Of America happy. Why do the oppisite? If the people are happy, and there is a comander in cheif, then its a win win situation. Every ones happy. The whole point. Why would anyone try to mess that up and change things causing chaos and unhappiness? I thought it was for the people not aginst the people. Im not wrong, and if it changes and the people are unhappy, do you really think thats going to have a positive impact on the economy and society? Unhapiness, living under terms and conditions thats in no ones favor. Sounds nice, that was sarcasim Senator, I dont know if youve ever heard of it. Overall I think that popular vote is the choice to go with for electing our future President of the United States Of America.

Sincerly, PROPER_NAME
