Senator i argue that the state shouald change the system to change the election by popular vote. The people say its unfaire the way the vote for president.

But on the outher hand in peragraph ten it states that the electoral college voters vote dont go to the president,but they go to state electorsm, who in turn elect the president. this may seem fair but its unfair to voters. Becase of the winner-takes-all system and in each state candidates don' spend time to know who they are electing.

First of all not only are candidates wanting to vote for the person thay want to they dont have a chance popular vote wont win.

but on the outher hand elctoral vote seem to work out for some candidates. Voters in presidentialelections are people who want to express a political preference rather than people who think that single vote may decide an election.

i belive that bob dole was right to abolish the electoral college it makes it fair to the candidates.
