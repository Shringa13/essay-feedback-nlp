There could be many explanations for this mystircal face, although, the face could have just been created by the planet when formed, or it could have been made by something unexplainable. How do you think the face was formed?

The face is more than likely just another natural land form, just like here on earth, we have natural land forms that look like living animals or plants. The likely hood of the face being unatural is very slim. Being that the face had not changed for 25 years, it could mean that this is just a land form that has existed since the planets beginning.

The face is similar to a natural land form here on Earth, in the Snake River Plane of Idaho. The face shows that it is possible for it to be anything, it could be alien made, but it is highly unlikely. There has not really been any true evidence that aliens exist.

Skeptics may believe that the face could be more proof that aliens exist in outer space. Which could very well be, but there is still no strong evidence that it is true, we could be the only living planet in space.

Concluding the face is extremely likely to be just a natural formation that the planet had when it was developing. There is also no completely proof that it is alien proof, and making a face on a planet would not be the best way to comunicate with humans.
