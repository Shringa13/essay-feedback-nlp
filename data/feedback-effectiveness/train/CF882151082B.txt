Do you like extracurricular activity? If you dont know what that is some examples are sports,newspaper,and student council. I believe that students should choose at least one extracurricular activity,because it will make students more social,and they get to see what they like doing.

How will extracurricular activities make students more social? Since,most clubs make it so you have to talk to some one you will eventually talk to another student. Also you might find some one who is interested in the same things as you and make a friend.

Being in a extracurricular activity could help find what you like doing. For instance,you could find that playing football is your thing. With all the different activities there is no way you will not find the thing you like.

HopefullyÂ I convinced you to be on my side. However, if your still not convinced that is fine. In conclusion,extracurricular activity help students be social and find what they enjoy.
