Dear senator I have a problem with the current voteing procesess. You see senator with Electoral Collage the votes can be swayed very easily, all one would have to do is threaten or bribe the voter into voteing for that particular person. This in-turn could effect the outcome of the voteing procesess greatly be it by leagal or ileagal means. Beacuse of this i think the voteing procesess should be based off of the popular vote so that it would be difficult for one to do what was stated above. But this is only one persons opinion there is also the other side of this.

There is another group that thinks that the voteing procesess should stay the same. i think that this group thinks this because they know how to get around the system or play it. Doing so makes it easy'er for them to have someone that they trust or control on the top of the game. But then if this ocuurs are we really choseing our president, i dont think so. Even still that is only my opinion.

This is what I think the outher group wants to achive. You have read what i thought on this subject and i hope to bring you over to my side on this argument. There is curuption every were and we need to stick together, if we dont then who can we trust. Make your vote count and help make the U.S a better place. Hope this helped you decicde on who to pick.       Â
