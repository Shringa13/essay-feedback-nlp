In my opinion i believe that our principle should consider the choice on having students use their cell phones during the school day. I think it would be a good idea if our teachers or our principle give students permission to use cell phones during lunch and other free times that we have, as long as we don't use them during our class time.

One of the reasons why i think it's a good idea to consider the choice on having cell phones during school time is because there can be an emergency at home and our parent's can either text us or call us.! As long as we pay attention to our teachers during class i think it would be an awesome idea.

I think it would be dumb if our principle doesn't consider the choice to let us bring cell phones to school because either way student bring them and they still use them during class time so if our principle doesn't consider this idea it would be the same either way. But i think it would be better if she does choose to let us students use our cell phones during a free time or during lunch.

Students would use their cell phones freely without trying to hide from a teacher or an adult while using a cell phone, without believing they are getting their phone's taken away. So i really believe that our principle should really go back and think about these options. Students would be more than happy to have the permission to use their cell phone and I also believe that they wouldn't take advantage of their permission to use cell phones, but that's just my opinion on this case, other student might think different than me, so that's why i think that our principle should really think about this opinion.
