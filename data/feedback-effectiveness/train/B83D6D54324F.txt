Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I know as well as anyone else that sports are important in a child's life. Some students are incredibly gifted at sports, but others may not be. However, sports are a privilege, not a right. Many schools have a policy that students must obtain at least a D average which is barely passing. I don't think that this should be so. Although I don't think that the policy at our school should be changed to obtaining a B average either.

Many students excel at sports while others at schooling. Although there are some students that exceed in both of these fields, obtaining a B average is rather hard for some students, especially with being in a sport. Sports require team practices which are very exhausting on the body and the mind. Sometimes, when students get home from these practices, they don't have the energy for much. I know you are thinking that school is more important that sports, and most parents would agree with you, but without sports and exercise the childhood obesity level would skyrocket as it has in the last few years within adults.

I think that changing the activity participation grade level to a B average is a little extreme. However, I don't think that it should stay at a D average. Student's should actually have to try in school to have the privilege of being in a sport, but at a D average they don't have to. The policy at our school should be changed but not to an extreme of a B average. I thank you for your time and cooperation.
