No it does not work because it is very un fare to the millions of voters in the U.S. Mainly because alot of the states donot even see an ad for the presidential campaign. Also because it is not winner takes all like it is for most states. So it is not fair mainly just because of bad publicity. Also because the presidential campaign could come down to one persons vote and depending if he is bias or not it would be very unfair.

The electoral college does alsonot work because it was created by our founding fathers. Which was all the way back when this country was first starting out. So the ways that they do it is so old and does not work anymore. These are the reasons why i think that the electoral college does not work. Anymore in todays modern times where it is all out dated.
