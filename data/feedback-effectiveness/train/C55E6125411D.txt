If you are sane at all, you would not allow cell phones. Distraction, kids could run into each other in the hall ways using them. Then, they will take up all their time using them in the free periods. I am scared for my fellow peers safety and education. Honestly.

Imagine this, a school full of kids crashing into each other... A mess of supplies on the floors every where. Do you want that responsibility of being the janitor at the end of the day? Think of the law suites for even thinking about allowing this in school. I shudder at that thought. People will regret it to a point were they won't even think about bringing cell phones to school. Don't do it, or your going to be digging your own grave.

Think of all the homework assignments left undone because student are to busy talking to even care. All of the failed tests because no one studied, not giving a hoot. The school shutting down, kids being moved to a different school. And who's fault was it? Yours. I like school, I know it is rare, but please... no cell phones! I want to see my teachers again. Day after day, have some pity on one child. Think of tomorrows future, don't you want to be apart of shaping it?

In a small conclusion, no cell phones in the school. Kids will make a mess with all that bumping into each other. Finally, the education going on with drop like a bomb. So, please don't make your own hectic sound-track from all the noise. Thank you.
