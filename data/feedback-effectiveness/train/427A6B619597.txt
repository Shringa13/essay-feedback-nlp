Hi my name is Luke and I think you should participate in the seagoing cowboys program because you get to see trueley beautifull places and you get to be on the ocean wich is another bonus and you get to love and care for the cute and adorible horses on board plus you dont have to worry about them running out of food because we always carry enuff to venture the far and cool places we go to.

One reason you should come with us in the seagoing cowboys program is that we venture to cool and foriegn places like china and i got to see the Panama Canal,all and all it's just a realy good experience and you would like it if you are an outgoing person.

Another reason you should come with us is because the animals they are realy cute and fun to be around all tho they do take some care its nothing compared to having an adorible animal to keep you company when you are alone.

The last reason in my opinion is you get to be out in the ocean and who doesn't love that and it just gives you time to explore and have fun with everything the animals the ocean the adventure and the quitness of just hereing the waves and having a great time.

And that is why i think you should come aboard with us because all and all you would just have a great time.
