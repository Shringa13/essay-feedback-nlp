Not using cars or not using cars as much can be extremely benefitial to not only the enviroment but also to the health of people .

Getting excersise is extremely important in modern times heart diesease is a major factor in todays society and that can be easily prevented with minutes of excersise everyday .

The less you drive the more your bound to walk or ride a bike to your destination .

While having completely carless communities can be an inconvinice .

Cutting back on car usage and even using hybrid cars can be benefitial to the enviroment .

Even in the United States cars are becoming less relivant.

Not because they are not useful but because cities are becoming so compact that there is no longer a use to drive cars to stores and shops. The only time people drive is for long distance or to work or school when it is cold or raining. If I could ride the bus to and from school I would, but, they refuse to pick me up in the mornings so I drive my moms

SUV

istead while im not complaining because I dont have to ride in sticky seats or be constantly harassed by the kid behind me kicking my seat. Driving an

SUV

(which is also extremely hard to park)

is not a very efficient way to get to school. While I tried walking it was difficult getting to school on time and i was depleeted of energy.

So driving became the most efficient way.
