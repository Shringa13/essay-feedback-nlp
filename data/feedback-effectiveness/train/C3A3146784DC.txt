Dear TEACHER_NAME

What is wrong with having our phones out during school?

I can understand having them out in class is wrong but what's wrong with having them on lunch or tutorials?

Sometimes I think grownups just do things to restrict us with no probable cause. Let us having our phones out during times like lunch will probable even help us with school it will make us eager to come to school because we'll be having more fun. Come on you cant really sit there and give me reasons why that's a rule it's supposed to be a free country.

I know, understand, and believe why we wear seat belts, why drugs are illegal those things make sense but this doesn't so im saying with the entire school on my side lets try cell phones just for times like lunch or even a couple days out of the week. So im definitely going with policy one now im going to tell why policy two is a bad choice. what if there's an emergency and we need to call some one or someone in our family is hurt and my family is keeping me updating. so how can you possibly go with policy one

P.S. Just give us a chance
