Im Evan and a guy at my work named John says that the Face on mars was created by alien's. I told him "Its not created by aliens and me and others at NASA have proof". He said "show me the proof than EVAN!!!". So I then went to get my boss and asked him if i could see the pictures and articles about the face on mars. He said i couldn't see them right away because he needed them so i gad a wait a whole day. The next day my boss handed me the paper and i was so exited to go to John's face and show him the facts.

The first things i showed him were the 3 pictures because it shows how it looked over all those years. Then i showed what NASA said, which was "Huge rock formation which resembles a human head formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth." The authors reasoned it would be a good way to engage the public and attract attention to mars.

It was a pop icon, it starred in a Hollywood film, appeared in books, magazines, radio talk shows, even haunted grocery store checkout lines for 25 years!!! I told john "Even only a little bit of scientists believe the face was an alien articraft.'

Encountering the face on mars was not an easy task i told him, and they just don't pass over it very often said Garvin i told him. They even took other pictures where the pixel size was 3 times bigger so if there was other objects like aircraft or pyramids they would be able to see them. The face looks like Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. Then i asked him "Now was that enough proof for you to believe me' and he said i'll tell you tomorrow. John went home and did research, when he came back he said "yes I believe you now." After that i was like want to be friends and he said Yes.
