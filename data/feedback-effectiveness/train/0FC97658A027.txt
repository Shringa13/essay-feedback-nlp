Dear Principal,

To begin with, I think this world is here to be on and do anything we want too.

But I think that our community is important to us because its a place to have fun with friends and family.

But its full of different kinds of both good and bad stuffs.

I think every student in schools should Perform in community service.

Not only student parents can also volunteer if they want too.

We can find a way for students to participate to perform community service, like do a party or have fun after participating

But some might say it takes up their planning time but I think if everyone participates it wouldn't be so hard. We could also find a way for them like do it twice a day or schedule a time so they can do they can do what they need to do.

I think if we take care of the community other place might do it too.

This could change the community and the whole wide world.

I hope everyone perform community service.

Sincerely, your student at SCHOOL_NAME
