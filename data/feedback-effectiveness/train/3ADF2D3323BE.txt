TEACHER_NAME

Allowing students to use cell phones at school is alright as long as you don't use them in class. The reason why I say this is because when you are in class the teacher is teaching and if you start using it, it's disrespectful. Also, you'll get caught and your phone will be taken away. When you start having free time or lunch period, then its alright for you to use your phone because nobody is teaching you. My opinion is that its better off if we can use our phones while having lunch or break time, so nobody can tell you to put your phone away or take it away from you because its our time to do whatever we want to do.

Using phones in class is really disrespectful and you'll never learn anything in class. If you are in a middle of a class, your teacher is teaching and suddenly you have a phone call or text. you shouldn't pick it up. Ignore the phone and stay with what the teacher is teaching you about. Also, you shouldn't leave your phone on in class because then its easier to concentrate what teacher is telling you. If your phone is on then your phone will vibrate, ring, and bother you. Then the phone's noises will urge you to pick it up.

The bell ring's and its time for lunch or break time. Now, finally you can use your phone. Nobody is going to bother you and no teacher will be teaching you. So, now you can do whatever you want. Look at the text your friend gave you or call him. Also, no teacher or principle will come up to you and take your phone away because it's your time to do whatever you want. If the school's were like this, then nobody was going to pick up there phone's in class and they were going to wait until free time.
