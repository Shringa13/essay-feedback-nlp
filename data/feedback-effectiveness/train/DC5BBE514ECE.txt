In the article "Making Mona Lisa Smile", the author is presenting and explaining the new technology that has been made on human an computer communication. In the article he talks about technology that has been created to alter the learning curve in our new generations children. The new technology could completely change the way that our new generation learns. By taking a little movement in your face and mathematical putting your face into numbers.

For example, in paragraph six the author says, "for example, if you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow". The author tells how this new face decoder could change your learning path by choosing if you should slow down because your confused, or keep up if you follow with a lesson. The author is just supporting the claim that this new technology should belong in a classroom.

The author supports bhis claim once again in the first paragraph he says "she's 83 percent happy,9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry." The technology the author has been talking about this whole time just put Leonardo da Vinci's painting Mona LIsa face into one and zeros.

If this incredible machine can help our youth than I think everyone should agree on it. The new technology the author talks about is the best helping hand to students. The computer could be the student own personal tutor. This is a revolutionary turn on the eduacation of students.

The author also talks about testing the reader in this article by making you make a smiling face in paragraph seven and testing if you felt happier just by making the facial expression. By just tensing up the muscles for an facial expression can actually give the expressions of the facial movement.

The article gives plenty of prove to show that the machine could be a benefit to are students. the article points are clear and strongly backed behind. The gives every expression that his new technology is good.
