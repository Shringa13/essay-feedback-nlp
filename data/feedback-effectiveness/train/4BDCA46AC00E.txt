I disagree with student having to have a grade B average to be able to participate in school activities because it's not so easy for some kids to keep their grades up when they also have school activities and making this new rule would be taking a lot of fun opportunities from students that have trouble with school work.

First ,I disagree because it's not easy for some kids to keep their grades up when they also have school activities. Students are going to be put under a lot of pressure if they have to keep up with school work and take school activities which could cause stress. Also students sometimes won't be able to keep up with all the work and activities after school.

Next, I disagree because making this new rule would be taking a lot of fun opportunities from students that have trouble with school work. Students could have scholarships from playing basket ball and football which are school activities and could make them successful in life but if they have to still get a grade B average then this makes it harder for them to achieve.

Students don't deserve to be put under pressure like that because its bad for their health.

In Conclusion, I disagree with students having to have a grade B average to be able to participate in school activities because it's not easy for some kids to keep their grades up when they also have school activities and making this new rule would be taking a lot of
