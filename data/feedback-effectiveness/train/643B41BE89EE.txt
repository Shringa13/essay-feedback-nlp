Dear Senator,

I think that Electoral College is not the way to vote in the future. We should make a change in our goverment and make elections by popular vote. For these reasons we should make changes. We don't know who the electors vote for. The Electoral College is unfair. Popular vote is more accurate.

If we are going to have Electoral College lets at least know who our elector votes for. "Can voters control whom their electors vote for? Not always." By this I mean, not letting him choose who ever he's going for. As in of showing that he took everyones vote and made them all count. Even if the guy he's going for wins the election, we can say it was fair.

The Electoral College is not fair. First of all we don't know who picks the electors. We don't know if there truthful as in putting in votes. I'm sure they have to have certain requirments to become an elector but we are not the ones chosing them. In the 2000 campaign 17 states didn't even see the people running in the election. Also in an Electoral College ties exist so then it has to be thrown into the House of Represenatives where the delagations will vote on the president. Making our votes worthless because the people in the goverment get to chose whos next to become president.

Popular vote is more accurate. By me saying this is that everyones vote counts. There's no electors invovled causing you to fall in doubt. Even though it says that Electoral College electors "...that trust is rarerly betrayed." I still think that the people will cofide more in popular vote showing them that they didn't just vote for no reason.

Electoral college is getting more and more complicated causing people to doubt. We should change because we don't  know who the electors vote for. The Electoral College is unfair. Also because popular votes are more accurate. Electoral College is irrational and not accurate.
