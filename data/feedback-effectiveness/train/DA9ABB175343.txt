Dear senator of Florida,

I'm a highschool student who is very involed with polotics and i wanted to write this letter to let you know that i am in favor of getting rid of the electoral college. I belive that the elcetoral college causes big problems during election time . For example when people say that the electoral college is not taking into consideration to what the people said but only caring about who they want as our president. There are five reasons to keep the electoral college, but there is many reasons to get rid of it for good. i know most peole or adults that really vote and our into politics would say otherwise but i beleive that we should get rid of it and really let the people have a voice and not have a group of people speack for us. When i was little they used to tell me that you learn something new evertyday and they were righty i leaen morwe and more everydsy that the electoral cvollege is unconsitional in my eyes why have a group ogf peopole speack for us we have avoice we can do it o our own we need to get rid ofg the electo5ral college for good. So that the peoplew of the

United States of America have a say so in who we choose to run our country. Mr. Senator if you would take this into consideration that the electoral college is bad and we need to get rid of it the people during election time would be so happy because whoever wins the vote ffrom the citiens wins the election not a group of politions who procide over us citizens. mr. Senator thak you for reading my letter, because it could help me get my voice heard about getting rid of the electoral college.

Sincirerly, PROPER_NAME
