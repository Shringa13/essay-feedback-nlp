Since the planet Venus is the closest planet to earth's density and size scientist have been trying to explore the posibilites Venus could have. Venus is the second planet from the sun which means it is very hot. Venus is 800 degrees fahrenheit and is 90 times hotter than what we experience of earth. Humans have sent many spacecrafts to Venus, but none have sucessfully made it, the ones that have landed didnt make it longer than a few hours. A spacecraft hasnt touched Venus in more than 3 decades. Venus has an atmoshere of 97 percent carbon dioxcide.

Scientists want to explore venus because since it is the closest planet it earth maybe at one time it had life. Venus likely had a great amountof ocean water and could of had many lifeforms. Venus would be our closest option if we visited a planet. Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray. A blimp like vehicle hoverig 30 or so miles above the roiling Venusian landscape would be a good option.
