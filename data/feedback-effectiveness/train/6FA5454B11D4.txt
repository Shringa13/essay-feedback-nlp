Dear principal,

I do think that students should be required to do community service. Students should take care of their community by keeping it clean. Performing community service can help student get jobs in the future. The final reason is that it'll just make them feel good about themselves knowing they've helped out their community.

When i say keeping the community clean i mean clean all the litter and trash that some people carelessly throw on the street. Get a community cleaning program started. Every weekend or so get together with your group and head out into the streets and pick up what ever lose trash you find and dispose of it the right way. I think this is the most important reason that students should do community service.

Second off community service will look good on a college or job application. Say you write down that you've worked in a soup kitchen or at a local retirement home it will more likely get you a better career. It might take some time out of your day but even when your helping those in need at the end of the day you really just helped yourself.

The third and final reason is it just make you feel good about yourself. If you help a mentally disabled or physically disabled person that is less fortunate than you understand that you have more than you can ask for while some others don't even have a home, a good brain, or even body parts. If you help the needy and you say to your parents this is nice helping others they'll look at you as a more mature adult knowing that now you know not to take anything for granted and enjoy all the little things.

These are just a few of the many reasons that students should be required to perform community service for the school.
