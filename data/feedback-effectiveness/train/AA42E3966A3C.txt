I think students should that policy 1 because they can bring there phone to school and just use doing there free or when they let them use it . And its very inportan to have a phone at school just in case something happiness to you or when your on the bus you never know what could happen . And when students have phones out they should give them a warning to put it away not just take it way and make them pay $10 and bring there parents that's just rude to do to someone give them a chances . when they give them a warning they should just write there name down and the next time they do cheek if there name has been writhen down and if yes then they may take it way but if not don't take it away . And just in case it fails just let then pick it up and tell then to stick it back in the locker and if they dont wont then hold it for them until the end of the day and give it back to them . okay well if your in class teaching and the phone ring then you may take it way cause it should be off it only if its free time or if let you .
