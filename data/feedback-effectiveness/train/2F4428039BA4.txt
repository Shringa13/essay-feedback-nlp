If you join the program you can see alot of stuff that not that many people get to see at all the text states,"Luke also toured an excavated castle in crete and marveled at the panama canal on his way to china."

if you do you get to help people and help animals. It is cool because you go around at sea alot. The text states," Luke had made nine trips --the most of any Seagoing cowboy." you get to do fun stuff to like play games and outdoor activites. most of the time if oyu are not careful and don't look oyu could get hurt and the fall off the ship. you go to alot of cities and countries. oyu have to be ready though cause if you are not you might not know what is going on for every body. that is why you should go and do that program because it is really fun and you do alot of cool stuff and do alot of cool stuff so you should do it and go around the world and have fun doning it.
