Well to start with ,they need to keep the most popular one by elections because it would be fair to people to have the electoral votes. its absoutly a great idea in my presice ! i think that people should vote on what they want to do not the senate or house of the united states . Also , it seems to me that the votes keep going down because people dont like the way they have to vote its going astronomical they need to take control NOW ! Even though candidates might now want to spend time going through the head ache of focusing on because to me its the most baic level and it UNFAIR to all voters all around the globe . Allthough my opinion is people need to realize to some of the overruled voters are all not electoral college dont mean you cannot vote for regular its entirely inpossible for the "new president" not to win and thats one reason why people pick that source because they know for a fact that they wll win their president they voted for this on coming "election" . ALL votes go to the house / state senate and it goes uphill from there so according to the passage all the electroal college requires a presidental candidate to have a regional appeal . But in 2012 President Barak Obama almost didnt make president until they put the electroal votes all together and we won PRESIDENT !! But of course knowing your vote you need to have to pay attition to the camapaign that the presidentcy were picked by a popular more VOTE . Even though votes swing on a national election one and a half americans express a petherance than a acual single vote which is probalbly much faster and easier on us and the senate. Knowing that people want to make sure our country stays in place they vote the correct presdient for the next four years so make the correct descision.
