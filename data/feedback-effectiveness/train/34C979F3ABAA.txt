Is there an advantage to limit the car usage ? There alot of diffrent advantages like promoting,protection and bills .lets talk more about the advantages a little more . lets get this moving !

The frist advantage is promoting. the united states who is promoting the new communities that are less dependent on cars , (rosenthal) if you think about its a good thing because then it gives us less usage and thats a good thing not a bad thing for the people who think so its not .promoting is like you trying to sell somthing to someone and making it sell .thats what you call promoting somthing. the goal is to promote alterative transportation and reduce smog,(selsky)

The second advantage is that the protection. If the usage is reduce then the the greenhouse gases will reduce emissions from tailpipes ,(rosenthal) and thats a good thing becuase if you think about it it cant be a bad thing and never will be a bad thing .The greenhouse gases are a good thingnot somthing bad it helps plants grow. Millions of colombians biked,skated or took buses ,(selsky) and that even uses less green house gases.

The third advantage is bills. There will be bills passed 80 percent of apprpiation have gone to highways and only 20 percent to other transport, (rosenthal) and that makes it better if we have bills passed because that mean that we can do more if the laws are passed by the government. It was the third year cars have been banned with only buses and taxis permitted for the day without cars,(selsky).

Well at last i can warm this up the three advantages are that promoting , protection and the bills . That all helpsÂ  limit the usage of the cars. well thats all for now.
