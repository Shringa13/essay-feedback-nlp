Some people may ask multiple people for advice. This can be for many reasons. For many people they don't like only asking one person for advice because somebody might give better advice than someone else, also people have different views and opinions on things.

Advice is something that can impact a persons view in many ways. It can be helpful or harmful depending on what you say.

Speaking to more than one person to get advice can impact you positively, someone can use everything that many people said and use it to help them. Somebody might ask for an opinion of how they look, or what someone thinks of something.

The person that wants an opinion might want to ask many people because they want to know what is better to do, use, or wear. People always ask for an opinion. Some people do things based on someones' advice because they think it will be better or make the other person happy. In conclusion asking for an opinion can be beneficial to someone.Â
