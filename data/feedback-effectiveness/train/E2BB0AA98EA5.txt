Well i dissagree because,why can the teachers do the work always wanting students to help so i dissagree because if they can do it they shouldnt make other people wanna do it,but i would also work on the yearbooks beacuse you are the one who is doing it all so you do it the way u want to. Kids should also have multipul choices to choose what they wanna do because here they only give them like three options that honestly is not far well thats my opinon other people might think other wise. I also agree because it will help kids get personal stuff outta there mind example parents fighting,getting bullied,over thinking,depression,there are many more examples these are just ones that came out of my mind because i wouldnt really think about stuff like this. Student council is actually really good i used to be in it but i got kicked out because my behavior and grades when i was in it i didnt put much effort like i didnt care about it but it was the only thing that had my grades good and now since im not in it i never have anything to do i wish i would have not behave the way i had so i would have not gotten kicked out but it is what it is. The principal actually is thinking because he does what new things for them in life so when they grow up they can say i did this i didnt do this and on the other hand if u dont do that you wont be able to even have fun you have to try new things in life because without trying you wont get anywhere in life. I also think they should have more options for the students to choose because not all students might like those options maybe they have other things in mind like gaming like you never know what they could be thinking you should let them speak out maybe they have even better ideas you never know because students have open minds some people dont know that. I just want you to let the students have a voice and not just the adults but its your school you do you boo.
