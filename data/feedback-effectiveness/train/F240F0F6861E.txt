Dear Principal,

I think that kids should be required to do community service and I also think that it depends on what the parents say.

I agree that kids should have to do community service because it builds character what I mean by that is that being a in these times I know that we are lazier than what kids used to be. A lot of kids just text and are on facebook all day and some don't even do their homework. If kids were to do community service it would give them a good working habit and would help kids survive in the future of this bad economy.

In the past people helped each other get things done and it wasn't uncommon to see a child walking an old lady across the street. Now kids try to push people out of the way so they can get across the street. That's another thing that community service will help with is kids learning how to be courteous to their elders and also their piers. some kids don't know ow to act in public and be respectful but once community service starts to become a regular thing they will be. It will also help communities grow with each other so that everybody will start to get to know each other and work together.

I think a good addition to this system would be some type of reward system that would give kids motivation to actually do the community service and if they don't do it there should be a punishment like lunch detention or something of that sort. I think that what required community service would also help with is self discipline. It will teach kids how to get things done and done the right way and that will also factor in with school and how kids do on homework or projects and even studying for test which will really prepare them for highschool and college

Well I hope you go along with the community service idea because I think that its really going to help kids a lot.

Sinscerely
