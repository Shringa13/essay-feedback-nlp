Dear School Principal,

I believe for a student to have a B average should be able to participate in school sports or in other school activities is a reasonable policy.

It is privilege to be able to participate in school sports and activities cause you learn more things that are useful in the future and help you gain physical strength on some levels. You also should keep this as a school policy because you shouldn't be able to participate if you are either failing a class or struggling to pass that class you need you won't be able to have any ability to do so in school sports and all. The student is just taking the class for nothing if he/she is failing just to be in a sport and that they don't care about their grade. He/she needs to keep a B average to be able to participate for that gain of socializing and gaining special abilities.

As I student myself think that I keep a pretty good grade average and with my other students who are C averages students should also have help keeping a B average. I would love to start a tutoring club to help them, but some students may just be to stubborn to admit they need help then that will lead to the kicking off the team or club. So, I think we should urge students to come if they need help or at least want to stay on the team or club.

Thank you for listening to my reason of who you should make that a school policy. I am all for your decision. Have a nice day and thanks again.

Sincerely,
