the author of the story says that venus is very worthy pursuit because it is the closets to earth. What he means by saying closest is terms like density and size of venus is the same of earth. The author also says venus is our planetary neigbor. Venus does orbit the sun at diffrent speeds then us so that could be a diffulcty for us to get to venus to. we usaully are closer in time to mars then we are to venus at times.

Humans have already tried landing diffrent types of of space crafts to venus. those space crafts have all failed or have not survived more then a couple of hours on the surface. It would be very hard to survive in venus because of its condition its covered by blankets of corbon dioxide, clouds are corrosive sulfiric acid, 800 degrees weather, and the pressure is 90 times greater then earths. but venus could have all been eath like at one point. Venus could have been covored in oceans and supported many forms of life. scientist want to make blimp like cars so the humans that are sent to venus wouldnt have to touch the ground of all those gases.

This is why scientist think it a worthy pursuit to keep studying venus. they are getting closer and closer to overcoming this challange. they have allot of options on how to survive on venus. Once they get it it can help us with allot of things. thats why scientist wont stop studying venus.
