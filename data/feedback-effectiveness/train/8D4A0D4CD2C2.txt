"Hey" said Jerry "Did you hear about the face found on mars?" I said "Yes I did." Jerry said "I think that this face was created by aliens." I said "You really belive that aliens created this face? You know aliens aren't real, right?" Jerry said "I still think that it was made by aliens, and we don't know if aliens are real yet. Who knows, what if the aliens came before we launched our rover."

I said "I know that it could just be a rock formation and that the sun was shining on the rock in just the way that it looked like a face. Also who knows we could have just been in the right place at the right time." But Jerry always has to counter argue with me because he just wants to be right. "Have you heard that people all over the world are also saying that it is a formation created by aliens." Said Jerry

"Listen" I said "Just because you say what other people say does not mean that every body is right" Jerry said to me"I know for a fact that this is a monument made by aliens because no astronaut has gone to mars yet. Who would of made this if no one was there, I know that there is no way for you to prove to me that this was not made by aliens."

I said to him "There is a way that it was not made by aliens. It was made by natural formation." Jerry said "do you really think that, what kind of answere is that, saing that it was made naturally. Wow some people." I said to Jerry "what about this it was made by the rover running over rocks and they tumbled to make the face like appearence."

"Ok you got me, but i still have my own opinions." Said Jerry. "I knew I could do it" I said. "Finally I did it, Jerry listen, It was made of a lava dome." Jerry said to me "ok you win.
