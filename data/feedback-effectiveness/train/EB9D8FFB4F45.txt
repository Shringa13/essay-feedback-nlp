Hello Mr. senetor, my name is PROPER_NAME and i want to talk about some inportant stuff. For on i want to keep the electoral Collage . This is a syste that has been happeing since our founding fathers have been on earth.Â  Its where they vote for the pesident and vice president of United States of America. Now you want to get ride of this great tradistion that we do. I know sometimes we might get confused and vote for the wrog candidate. But that is not all of us. Everyone thinks its a disastor factor. The electoral collage will improve and will keep improving.

In the text it says " The electoral college is widely rgarded as an anachronism, a non-democratic method of selecting a priesedent that ought to be overuled By declaring the candidate who recives the most popular votes the winner . The advocates of this positionare correct in arguuing that the electorl collage method is not democrticin a modern sence. It is the electors who elect th president, not the people . When you vote fora pesidentian candidate youre actually voting for slate of electores."

Thats what the text said and we dont want that. Us the people want to vote for who we want to. This will be something big if we can keep this thing going.
