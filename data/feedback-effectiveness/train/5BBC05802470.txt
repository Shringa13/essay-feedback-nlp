No i think having technology to read a emotional expressions of students. I think that is really not a good idea . Why because somebody dont like to know how they feeling some people don't like to express their feelings cause it's nobodys bussnies . Tell me would you let them use and technology to read your emotions somepeople would say yes somepeople would no because either the way it goes your still messing being in somebodys else bussnies and some people don't like when they do things like this makes people think that where watching their life . No i disager with the technology to read emotional expression becaue it's like their trying to find a good way to gets us totechnology againts use and try to take over are emotions think about it. Think about how something bad can happen ifthey use the technology to read expressed something can go wrong to where the technology ain't gone be working like its is supposed i think they trying to use itn against take over are mine makes us feel how they want us to feel say what they want us to say
