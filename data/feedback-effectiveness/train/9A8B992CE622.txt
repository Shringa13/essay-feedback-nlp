Why should we have to use technology to tell peoples emotions. In the case of Mona Lisa i can see why they would use it there. It states that she`s 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry. I wouldn`t have known that if not for tech. Why should we calculate emotions. We shouldn`t have to use 3-D computor model to tell the emotions of people. All we have to do is look in a mirror. Raise your lips at the corners of your mouth. Then squint your eyes slightly, to produce wrinkling (crows feet) at the corners of your eyes. Holding that, raise the outer parts of your cheeks up, towards your eyes. Using technology produces a fake smile. We want real smiles. Besides your home PC can`t handle the complex algorithms used to decode a smile. But we can write down some simple instuctions that encode different emotions. So all i just said is basicly saying i don`t want this to be used.
