Well, I suppose it coud have been made by aliens, but as we continued to research it. It became known to us that something was casting a shadow as we said in our article about the "Unmasking the Face on Mars" said in paragraph 3. NASA

releasing it in the hopes while it was coming to public. To sale in stores and area in business ,and it did. Hoping it to be real so we can lead people into the existence of it being real. But noticing ourself that it wasn't true that it wasn't real.

Sadly for us as believers of life on other planets and creation of art from other living things.

In April 5, 1998 when we snapped some pictures ten times as better than the Viking did we notice that it was just a landform a big rock formation. The location of the Face of Mars is 41 degrees north martian latitude where it is winter in April on Mars very cloudy during this time so lots of winds,and dust blow past and covers the rock formation. The picture actually just shows us that is just like a regular formation on Earth as said in paragraph 12 ,and also looking identical to landforms in the American West area.
