Hello, my name is Hannah. I am a scientist at NASA who has been studying the "face" on Mars over the years. Today my close friend Mason had asked me about any imformation I've found out recently. I said,"Well, it just appears to be a natural formation rather than something that was created." He argued and argued over how the aliens built it,and how its just been hidden all these years.

In a shorter explaination I told Mason that the shadows show how they do on Earth on natural formations. He didn't quite get it so I showed him a messa and how they shadow. He still thought the marsians made the formation of the face.

The next day, he talked to me about the same thing. Only this time I knew that I could prove to him that the "face" was only natural. I pulled up the pictures taken over the years and let Mason examine them very carefully. The picture taken in 2001 shows that there is nothing else around the face. If there was anyhting on the ground such as an airplane or a shack, you have been able to tell what it was. But there was nothing. Mason still didn't agree that the form on Mars was a natural landform.

It was now the third day he has argued over the face on Mars. But this day, Mason didnt argue with me. He asked to see the pictures again, along with pictures of a messa and a butte, which are natural landforms here on Earth. Mason looked for hours and hours and hours. He finally spoke up,"Maybe you guys here at NASA are right.. It seems to be completely natural.." I replied,"I told you old pal. Next time you should look into something more before you argue about it."

The next morning Mason came to work with me. The other scientists and I all came agreed that the face on Mars was completely natural. Not only did NASA finally figure out how to "unmask the face" and call it a natural landform, but they also provided a lot of information that way people understood it better. To this day the "face" is known to be a natural landform!
