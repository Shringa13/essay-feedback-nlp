The use of FACS should not be used to see if children are happy in the class room. The reason being is if a kid is upset about what happen at lunch and doesnt want the teacher to know the teacher shouldn't know. IF the kid wanted the teacher to know the kid would stay after class and tell the teacher the proble. i jiust dont think that there should be that kind of technology inside of a class room.

Now if it was for an expermint to see how you are really feeling then go ahead but only for an expermint. the expermint could be hpw many real emotions can one person feel all at the same time. The computer could tell you all the emotions what percent your feeling them and that how you get your expermint.

A teacher should not do it to anyone who does not want it done to them. That would be the only real problem with having it inside a class room. There could be a public room inside the school for the computer, so kids can go and see what they are feeling before class. That is an option for the school.

The only way i think it is a good idea to have that kind of tecnology inside school is if it has its own room inside the school. That way all the kids that want to use the computer can use it.
