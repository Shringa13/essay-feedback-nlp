A boy named luke that graduated for high school and had worked two part time jobs in a grocery store . His friend had ask him if he wanted to go to Europe on a cattle boat ,luke said yes he said he couldnt have said no beacuse he doesnt like saying no to people. And he also said that it was a oportunity of a lifetime. It was 1945, world war ll was over in Europe, and many countries were left in runis . And too hope that those familys recover on food and animals. Then there were sign ups for a UNRRA Seagoing Cowboy and so Luke and Don sign up for it .In August 14,1945 ,'' Luke said , the day the Pacific war ended.'' they got their seaman's paper and boarded the SS Charles W. Wooster , headed for Greece- with a cargo of 335 ho rsees plus enough hay and oats feed them . L uke turned 18 before arriving in Greeece , which meant he he could be draft ed gfor military service.

When my draft board learned that i was on a cattle- boat trip , they h ad told me to just keep doing t hat for my service . 'by the time he was discharged in 1947 , Luke had mde trips - the mast of any saegoing cowboy. The cattle boat trip were an unbelivable oppportunity fo ra smalll towm boy,; he said , besides helping people , I had the side benefit of seein of seeeing Eurpe and China.

Then time past and Luke found time to hhave fun on board , especially on return trips after the animals had been unloaded . The cowboys played baseball and they aslo had played volleyball games in the empty holds where animals had been housed. Table-tennis tournament, facing , boxing, reading , whittling , and games als help pass the time . But being a Seagoing Cowboys was much more than an adventure for Luke Bomberger. it opened up the world to Luke e. '' i'm grateful for the opportunity'', he says . its made me more aware of people of other counties and their needs.'' And that aareness stays with him leading his familly to host a number of international students and exchange wisitersfor many years.
