Dear, State Senator

I belive that in favoring of keeping the Electoral College.Therefore many people have different minds set if which they should have Electoral college. Here 's some background information stated in source 1 What Is The Electoral College "The Electoral College is a process not a place'." The founding fathers established it in the constitution as a compromise betwwen of the president by a vote in congress and the election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens.'My reasons for this is because electoral college can be helpful,have people to rethink, and understandable.Many people thing of electoral college as torchure or even the wrong way to vote.Electoral college have different ways and similar ways from changing to the election by the popular for the president of United States.For example states in source one "The Electoral College consists of the 538 electors"."A Majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the president." Now as you can see in my essay there particular things I would like to talk about.Pertaining about how can electoral college can be helpful in a different ways of changing the president vote.For example what  might you think what would be helpful?Stated in source two people thinks "Under the electoral college sytem voters vote not for the president but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president". Now as you come to  mind this particular information is not only talking about coloubia is talking about the electoral collge also.According To Source Three "And if an electoral tie seems unlikely,consider this:In 1968, a shift of just 41,971 votes would have deadlocked the election;In 1976,a tie would have occured if a mere 5,559 voters in Ohio and 3,687 voters in Hawaii had voted the other way".People should rethink about their desicions before they pick and choose.According to source three "The Electoral Collge requires a presidential candidate to have transregional appeal.The  Electora is widely regarded as an anachronis, a non-democratic method of selecting a presiendt hat ought to be overruled by declaring the candidate who recieves the most popular votes.There are many diffent aspects of Electoral College.

Most importantly electoral college is that it can be understandable.It can be understandable by allowing people to knowing the method of electoral college.According to resource one "Electoral College method is not democractic in a modern snese...it is the electors who elect the president not the president.

In conclusion I strongly I favor of Electoral College because its can be helpful and let people rethink  about their decsion and understand the concept of voting for your president.
