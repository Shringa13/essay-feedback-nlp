Some student can take classes at home because they could find a subject of course that like. Learning websites can help them get better at what they do. It could benefit because they it would seem easier to go on different classes or to take a video to study a subject. For example, taking classes online would give you a head start. Many other schools have students at home take taking these course and have them apply for it.Â It is like a benefit for them to take some opportunity to get taught about something they have learn or to have a different way of learning it.

I will think they would able to do this if they are interested. For example, Home-schooling could that much money. There could be some reasons for them.

1. They want to try out some different learning strategies.

2. They can apply online.

3. They can try taking some subjects that they like.

In conclusion, it could be able to work for the home-schoolers to also have an education because they did not go to public but have it at home.
