Dear Senator,

I feel like we should keep the Electoral College because, "A disput over the outcome of a electoral college vote is possible but, it is less likely than a dispute over the popular vote". This means that that people would argue over the electoral college vote and who they voted for but but people most likely would not argue over the popular vote. They have done this before in 2012's election prosses with Obama and Romney. The second reason is that everyone will have to put ads up because not just one region of votes will make them president they are going to need to advertise everywhere.

The third reason is that "the winner-take-all method of awarding Electoral votes induces the canidates". This means to me that the method helps the canidates so they can win easily. The fourth and final reason is that the big staes get more votes because they have more people in there country so the automatically get more attention from the president. It is also easier for them to get what they want meaning they can reallly like choose any president they want and its a high percenatge that they will get that president.

Those are only some of the reasons that i think we should keep the Electoral College. To me I feel it would be easier to just do this other than count all the votes frome every single voter. Besides what other brillant plan can you come up with that is easier than this?    Â
