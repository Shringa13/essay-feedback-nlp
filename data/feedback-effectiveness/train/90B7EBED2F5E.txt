The "Face" that was found on Mars is not an aliens. The "Face" is simply just a huge rock formation which resembles a human head. If it was an alien the head would have anteanas on it and the head would be shaped differently than it is. Even though it was eighteen long years after the Viking Mission ended that we took a photo of the head doesn't mean that is is and alien.

On April 5,1998, when Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) flew over Cydionia for the first time,Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera(MOC) team took a picture. This picture was ten time sharper than the original Viking photos. When the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing... a natural landforn and not and alien.

Well not everyone was happy about it not being an alien. It's not easy to find the Cydonia. We just don't pass over the "Face" very often. But on April 8,2001 a cloudless summer day in Cydonia MGS went for another look. This time we rolled the space craft 25 degrees to center the face in the field. Malin's team captured an extradinary photo using the camera's absolute maximum resolution.

In conclusion, what the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa landforms common around the American West. The picture was never an alien head.
