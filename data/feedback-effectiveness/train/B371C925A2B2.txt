I think that using the techonogy to read student emotional expression of student in a class is valuable because it help to see if a student is happy/mad/sad .Like in the passage it's talking about how they are using this new technology call ''The Facial Action coding system ''Which mean -a system enables computers to identify human emotions . They are aslo using the 3-D computer model of the face ,As they can aslo calculate the emotions . As because you can see what is wrong with your friend/family .

One reason why I think it's valuable for technology to read your emontional expressoion on studnets is by the promgram ''Facial Action Coding System'' why because just by using a video as it sates in the passage 4 ''using video imagery the new eemotion recognition software tracks these facial movements ''they can see what kind of emontion you have and for them to help you out I am guessing or at less it can be valube for making them feel better .Also because is the system is what emotions that person has it can let other people know and just to keep an eye on them .I feel like it will work on other person as well it will help me out because sometimes my mom/daad get a serious face and I don't know if they are happy or sad .

It aslo can be valuable for student's in school because in that way you can help them out to feel better or sometines you just don't know wehn that person is feeling happy or sad as it states in the passage 5 ''You can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her/his face '' and the new technology can help you read their emotions the way they are feeling .Another reason why it can help on students with the new technolongy by the imagine as it states in passage 6 and just by the imagine the computer will know when you are happy or sad .This can help us by helping them out and for them not to feel that way becasue sometimes when student's get mad they do thing they know should't do but all that sadness or anger can take them over by casuing harm .As it will be nice to stop the harm from someone doing it. Another example is this Wed ad as stated in the passage 6 as well now this wed can see your other emotions as an example .''If you smile when a wed ad appears on your screen a similar ad might follow .But if you frown the next ad will be different .''A classroom computer could recongize when a student is becoming confused or bored '' As Dr. Hiangs predicts then he could modity thr lesson because they want the student's to pay attion in the classroom for them to learn and not make the class boring or for student to get lost and never asking question but as that to then the teacher will know what makes them get bored and what makes them get fouces . This will help for many toher student in school by not causing hram if they mad and aslo by helping student not get bored or lose fouces .

Now on my personal life I will say that the technolngy will help me by seeing how are people feeling when I see them walking around with there face down or just seeing them happy .Like for example lets say that I am walking around the hall way and see my freind wih a serious face or just them not talking to I will like to use the technolgy and see what is wrong with them and try to help them out with the feeling they have and just try to change their mood .Another reason why I will like to help is by seeing how does my mom feel when she looks at me like just take a picture of her and see what are the emotion she has or as in passage say in 7 an ''encode ''different emotions like make her look at her self in the mirror and follow the steps it say and see what are the emotion she has. But yes the technology ''The Facial expressio for each emotion are universal ''because it can help out in many awlays

As you see I do valuable the technology to read the emotional expressions of student in a class because it can help in many way to see the way they are feeling in there emotion and in there way of learing .Just like Dr. Huang he doesnt want his student to lose fouces and doesnt want them to feel sad either .Just like it will help in school for the student's .Also as using the 3-D computer mood just by seeing an imagine it can see what kind of feeling you are having . As yes it will be value to use later in ;life well it will help me with my friends and even my own kids and students at schools .
