The author explains to us how worthy it is to study Venus for example in the articel he claimes that Venus has so many features like earth for example like an ocean or a mountain he alos said there could even be some type of life form that could live there. There has been more and more people wanting to study this because of the fact that this one day might become another earth that we can live on and form some type of life on there but people have to test it out to see if we are able to live there for example to see if any animal life form can live there or even start bringing other to Venus for some testing. The big issue though is that the tempture gets really high like around 800 degrees for example it siads that "Venusian geology and weather present additional impediments like erupting volecanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightn skrikes to probes seeking to land on its surface." For example in paragraph 5 it saids " The National Aeronautics and space administration (NASA) has one particularly compelling idea for sending humans to study venus. NASA's possible solutions to the hostile conditions on the surface of venus would allow scientists to float above the fray. Imagine a blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above the rolling Vesusian landscape. Just as our jet airplanes travel at a higher altitude to fly over many storms , a vehicle hovering over Venus would avoid the unfriendly ground conditions by staying up and out of there way. At thirty-plus miles above the surface , temperatures would still be toasty at around 170 degrees fahrenheit, but the air pressure would be plentiful,and radiation would notexceed Earth levels. Not easy conditions, but survivable enough for humans."
