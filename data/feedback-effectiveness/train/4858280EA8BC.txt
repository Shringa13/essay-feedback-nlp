Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I STUDENT_NAME, have decided to write a letter to you that might be able to help you on this debate.

I hear that you have been considering giving all students that attend your school community service.

I may have some suggestions that suit you.

My main suggestion for you first and foremost is to try giving out a survey to all of the students that attend your school.

The main reason I say this is so that you know what your students mainly do with their day.

And so you know whether or not they have time to attend this community service.

For example; some students may have learning disabilities or maybe even have trouble understanding the work.

Or the students could have personal problems.

Such as suffering from depression, trouble at home or school, or even worse, etc.

All these situations could be effecting students in their every day lives.

I hope that I've made a very large and positive impact on others lives.

Because others have made one on my life.

So I hope that you take some time and think about this letter before you make any final decisions.

Because that one decision could impact many peoples lives in all sorts of ways.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
