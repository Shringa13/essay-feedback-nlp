When people ask for advice, they sometimes talk to more than one person. A lot of people think seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice. I think this is true because the more you know about something the e better and Easier for you to pick choice. Imagine this, you find out your mail was robbed. You know that the mail always comes at 2:30 and you saw when the mail man came and dropped it in front of your house. Then you saw two teens walking in front of your house. You might quickly regconise them and quickly call the cops but they wont get arrested on the spot. The police will have to have witnesses,and the teens

Point of View of the story

I always ask my friends what they think about something before making my final answer.

If people give you more opinions about something you will know like the pros and cons of what ever your asking about. Thats why i always ask my friends to give me there point of view in things, its easier for me to pick a choice between just by knowing whats better for me. Point of views will always help you doesnt matter what problem you have because you can literally figure an answer quickly.

I conclude my statement by saying point of views can really help you out no matter what and i just explained to you why.
