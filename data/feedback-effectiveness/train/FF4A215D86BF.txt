You should participate in the Seagoing Cowboys program it one chance oppurunity. It allows you to travel places you have not seen before and experienece new things. You will be able to take care of animals like the horses,young cows, and mules that were shipped over seas. You may be able to go sight-seeing on you spare time. "And your able to have fun onboard after unloading your able to play games such as baseball and volleyball gamesin the empty holds where animals had been housed. Table-tennis tournaments,fencing,boxing,reading,whittling,and games also helped pass time".

If you participate in Seagoing Cowboys program you wont have to have two jobs and it gives you a future job for after your highschool graduation. "You can be more aware of people of other countries and their needs." And that awarness stays with you". The more you travel the more you learn about all kinds of new things you might not have covered in school. Not only are you able to take care of animals you are able to help people.

My overall thought on becoming a Seagoing Cowboy is amazed by all the good you would be doing for the world. Espcially since there is a lot of ways that Seagoing Cowboys program change the world. Being in the Seagoing program there is a big resposibilty because you have to make sure everything is in order, you are not forgetting anything, and everything is going as planneed.
