You may think that the face on mars was created by aliens and we say it isn't it's a natural landform sorta like some natural landforms on Earth like the Grand Canyon it's a natural landform but we can't actually prve the the face is a landform but we have a spacecraft named Viking 1 and 2 that has taken pictures of it so we can see if it was formed by aliens or if it is just a natural landform.

Here is how we think that it is a natural landform, as it says in the article "As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size, se if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!"and it also says "What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa-landforms common around the American West it reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho that's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the face on Mars.

Even though we think it is natural landform you guys think that aliens have made it and your point is as it says in the article "The camera on board MGS had to peer through wispy clouds to see the face perhaps alien markings were hidden by haze."

So as it says in the article "It's not easy to target Cydonia Mars Global Surveyor is a mapping spacecraft that normally looks straight down and scans the planet like a fax machine in narrow 2.5 km-wide strips we just don't pass over the face ver often."

In conclusion even though the alien thing has a good point the pictures that Viking 1 and 2 got show that there are no alien markings and it is probably just a natural landform like the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho or the Grand Canyon.
