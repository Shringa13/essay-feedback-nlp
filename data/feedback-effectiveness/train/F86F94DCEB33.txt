Well i for one most defanitly think that an atomatic face reconation system it a amazing idea. the idea that the kid well be able to be more envoleved with there way of larning. we all now that children and adults both have things that there just better at.

dont u think beignable to have your scholl education chagne and be for what u can exsell in, and if not that than at lest being able to change it up a lil bit to keep every kid on trck and eger to learn more.

this comuter programe could help so many people be and do the best thay can at what they love. to start this kind of teaching now would most liky be a very costly proseger, but defanitly be worth evey last panny for the new breed of student, born of respect and hunger for the knowlege at hand.
