Dear, Principal

I think you shouldn't put everyone in community service because some of the kids don't need to be in it they didn't any thing bad i think only the bad people should do community service they do something bad they have to make it up for you but like that is up to you i am telling you what is on my mind of people want to help they can help but not all kids should do it like imagine if we all do it we would be mad at the people who is making us do it no its not you its the bad kids and no wants to mess there day because of them right or wrong well this is what i want to say to you and i hope we don't have to do community service but like if the kids are bad you don't have to put them in community service you cant take stuff away from them . Are they can stay after school and do there homework . well yah i hope you make the best chose .All of the students should have a other chance. If they want to do community service they an help little kids on there homework or clean up at the school or something .
