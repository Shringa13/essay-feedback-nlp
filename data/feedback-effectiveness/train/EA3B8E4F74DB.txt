Venus is the closest planet to Earth and one of the brightest points in a dark sky.

Venus is the second planet from the sun. Venus has proved it is very challenging to get data from the planet. The biggest question with Venus is it worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents.

Astronomers should try to get more data because it imbodys Earth more than any other planet.

Venus has features that are very simurlar to those on Earth. In "The Challenge of Exploring Venus" the author says "The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters."

It shows that Venus is very a like to Earth. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has had new and safe ideas so that we can still reserch Venus even with the dangers.

They want to floaut above the fray.

Wouldn't be easy conditions, but not hard enough to kill humans.

Now you know how dangers and worthy the explorion on Venus would be. But you sholudn't let a little fear get in the way of the fun and Knowlege on getting.

Wanting to do the challege on Venus has value, has dangers, and doubts but what are you scarred of you'll die any way.
