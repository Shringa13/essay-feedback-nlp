The use of this technology to read the emotional expression of students in a classroom IS valuable. it is valuable to read students emotions expression because if a student is sad and just wants to be left alone, or if a student is so mad and will go off for any reason then the teacher will know to leave those students alone. Another reason why the emothional expressions is that if they are in a play and you want they to actually feel those feelings. Plus you can tell if that person is being truthful or not.

First off the reasion you can use this technology to read emotional expressions is that Dr. Huang and his clleagus are experts that developed a new emotional - recongition software that tracks these facial movements, with characteristics movements of the facial muscules. For example is the text it states "your frontalis pars lateralis muscle (above your eyes) raises your eyebrows when you're surprised; your orbicularis oris (around your mouth) tightens your lips to show anger." This is how that computer knows how you are feeling, by look at your muscles. If they did have the emotional expressions inside of the class room then you will be able to tell if the student is telling the truth or not. By that you will know for sure of the student is lying to you or not and you'll figure out a way to punich them.

Second if you want the kids to really feel something and want to make sure they feel it then you'll know.

So this is why I think this technology to read emotional expressions of students inside the classroom.
