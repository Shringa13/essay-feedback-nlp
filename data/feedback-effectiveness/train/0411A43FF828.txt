How much value would come out of going to Venus? Scientists have tried many times to study Venus. Unfortunatley, they've always come out as failures. People could argue that the effort of studying Venus is useless and ineffective. However, scientists have little to no knowledge of how the planets in our solar system were made. Scientists could have more knowledge of Venus if they found a way to study the planet. The author of the article is right about the exploration of Venus being a worthy pursuit.

The author of the article does mention how difficult it is to study Venus by bringing up the planet's harsh atmosphere in Paragraph 3. Which further proves his point how valuable it is to study Venus. He also points out that Venus may have been a lot like Earth a long time ago in Paragraph 4. This doesn't just further our understanding of Venus, but it may also give us more information about Earth as well.

In Paragraph 5, the author mentions NASA's plans on how to study Venus. He does mention that those plans may have challenges fo their own in Paragraph 6. The author pushes to try those plans out in a realistic manner. The author being realistic with the reader, makes the reader want agree with him more.

The author backs up his suggestion with great evidence, but does it in a realistic way. He realizes how dangerous it is to study, but pushes for it by bringing up how little we know about Venus. The author's suggestion is correct and scientists need to find a way to study Venus.
