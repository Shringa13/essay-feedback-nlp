It is ridiculous that you think that this natural landform is created by aliens. It aliens would have created this why would they not leave a sign that it was them.

I believe this is a natural landform for many reasons. One is that the region of mars called Cydonia is filled with natural landforms like this one but this one just looks like an Egyption Pharaoh. Why would aliens go to Cydonia and make an alien artifact when Cydonia is filled with natural landform just like that one? On April 8, 2001 another spacecraft snapped an image of the face looking natural landform and found no trace of any sign of alien activity near the landmark. There were no people, airplanes, Egyptian-style pyramids, or even any small shacks anywhere near the landform. Why would aliens take the time to make this landmark if they were just going to leave and never come back.

It makes no sense why you would believe that aliens would have make this landform. You should believe me I am the scientist at NASA. In conclusion just trust me, the scientist at NASA, and just believe that this landform is natural not made by aliens.
