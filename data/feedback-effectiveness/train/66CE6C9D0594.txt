The author suggests that studying Venus is a worthy persuit despite the dangers it presents. I think the author has some valid details that support his claim, and it's enough to want to take a chance and know about our neighboring planet, Venus. I will be discussing the following, simplified electronics and mechanical computers to support the author's claim.

The author states that, "NASA is working on different approaches to studying Venus." One of these approaches are the simplified electronics that were tested in a chamber that is supposed to simulate Venus' chaotic surface, and lasted for three weeks. Another approach is mechanical computers which, "were first envisioned in the 1800s and played an important role in the 1940s during World War II." This device does not require electronics and they "make calculations by using gears and levers." Any regular, modern computer if exposed to acid or heat are capable of melting, as well as cell phones and tablets. This shows that devices that use mechanical parts can tend to be more resistant to such pressure, heat, and other forces.

I have concluded that though it is risky and dangerous to study Venus, I think it's worth knowing about it and it's contents. It's a great challenge for us humans but that is what makes it worth knowing about. What if Venus excedes our expectations and we find something that could possibly be life impacting? I think the danger and doubt would be worth it and our thoughts and assumptions would rest at ease.
