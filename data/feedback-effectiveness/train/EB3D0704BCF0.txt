dear school principal,

They should do community service. You may wonder why i' m writing this is because, the people who love to do community service should get extra credit. They should also get extra time after and before school to hang out with their friends. you ask why?? because they help a lot doing community service. cleaning up is good to the environment, but their wasting their time just doing the same thing over and over again. Like helping kids, is good to help them do better but you can get annoyed very easy. cleaning up the litter is good because if an animal eats aluminum foil it can choke and then die, you don't want that to happen right??? But the people who help should get day off of working and do school work, or help a teacher, that can be fun.

For the people who think community service is really weird, they should think twice because it can be fun, but it helps a lot in life. It can help the fact that you can do something that helps. ......ALOT! like you can help at home. Earn cash, to buy cleaning supply's. That can help save animals, humans, life. But for the who don't care to help, you should help, do some community service. You can get extra credit, you can help little kids and save animals life's. The fact that i want to do community service is to do all what i said, like help little kids, save animals life's, get some extra credit. Community service is actually pretty fun from experience, and i want to clean up litter.
