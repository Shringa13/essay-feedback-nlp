You should become a Seagoing Cowboy like me, Luke Bomberger! There are lots of things you can do! Did you know that not only a Seagoing Cowboy gets to experience places from all over the world and have a lot of freetime on the way back, but you also get to help people that are in need.

Get to explore places you've never been to! Just take it from me, "I had the side benefit of seeing Europe and China. But seeing the Acropolis in Greece was special. So was taking a gondola ride in Venice, Italy, a city with streets of water. I also toured an excavated castle in Crete and marveled at the Panama Canal on my way to China" That shows that you can see lots of places, but that isn't the best part!

You also have a lot of free time on the way back from a trip. When we unloaded all of the animals, "The cowboys played baseball and volleyball games in the empty holds where animals had been housed. Table-tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and games also helpes pass the time." We enjoyed the rides back, but even that isn't the best part!

The best part of being a Seagoing cowboy is helping people. When I became a Seagoing Cowboy, "It was 1945, World War ll was over in Europe, and many countries were left in ruins. To help these countries recover their food supplies, animals, and more, 44 nations joined together to form UNRRA. UNRRA hired "Seagoing Cowboys" to take care of the horses, young cows, and mules that were shipped overseas."

Well, I hope that I convinced you into becoming a Seagoing Cowboy like me. It's everybody's world. Let's help save the people in it.
