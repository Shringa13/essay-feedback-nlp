I don't think that studying Venus i a worthy pursuit because in the article it states that "humans have sent numerous spacecraft to land on this cloud draped world,since no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours"meanong no space craft has survied for more than a couple of hours. The article also states that "numerous factors contribute to venu's reutation as a challenging planet for humans to study"meaning its already a hard planet to study. The plant is also almost 97% carbon dioxide blankets venus. Venus is also a very hot place,in the article it states that "temperatures average over 800 degrees fahrenheit and a atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet". The article also says that "these conditions are far more extreme than anything humans encounter on earth" meaning that the tempertures are way too extreme for us humans. Humans arnt even going to live there so what is the point of pursuing studying venus. i don't think that it is a good idea to study venus because there is far to dangers.
