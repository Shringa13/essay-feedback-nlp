To Mr. Principal

I think that doing community service is a good thing and every one should do it, know i can get friends and people to help out to keep are community clean. So we don't hurt our planet, animals, and other things like our population . I think that the principle should acquire kids, teens, and adults to do so that nothing ever happens.

People all over the world should do community service because what would happen our fish die because some of us don't pick up after ourselves and the population goes down in poler bears, pelicans, and all sorts of nice loving veracious animals; because we don't make sure our rode' s, rivers, lakes, animals die so i' m saying everyone should pitch in at one time like on weekends or everyday so we don't loose a whole population because of it.

So Mr. Principle I'm saying that all people weather its student, parents, boys, girls, anybody and everyone should help pick up. know if people like bullies and rude and discourteous people don't help then they should have the right to choose or decide what they want to weather its to help or to not help, but remember if they don't or if they do they do its not our choice if they want to live in a bad or good community their the ones that want to be dirty and disgusting people not us.

So I'm saying yes you should require all students to pitch in and help keep our community clean, and who would want to live in a dirty or unclean place..... not me so Mr. Principle you should do what's right.
