I THINK THAT PEOPLE IN THIS SHOULD HELP THE COUNTRY ON DOING THE RIGHT THINGS LIKE DOING RECYCLING. PICKING UP TRASH. CAUSE I THINK THAT STUDENTS SHOULD GET TOGETHER IN HELP OUR SCHOOL BY DOING WORK. BEING THE PERSON WHO CLEAN THE COUNTRY BY PICKING THERE TRASH UP IN TAKING THERE TRASH OUT. AND THINK THAT SHOULD NOT DO COMMUNITY SERVICE CAUSE THATS TAKING AWAY THE EDUCATIONAL THINGS THEY HAVE TO DO IN LIKE BECAUSE MOST PEOPLE WILL LOVE TO CLEAN THE COMMUNITY. LIKE ME I WOULD LIKE TO BUT PEOPLE NEED TO GET TOGETHER.IN THE PRINCIPAL IS RIGHT BECAUSE THEY MAKE OUR SCHOOI AND COMMUNITY LOOK BAD.IN I KNOW I WOULD TRY TO HELP THE SCHOOL TO GET THINGS TOGETHER AND I KNOW I CLEAN MY ROOM AND DO THINGS FOR MY MOTHER. AND A MOST EVERY DAY I CLEAN THE FRONT YARD AND THE BACK YARD IF IT DIRTY OR LITTLE BIT MESSES.
