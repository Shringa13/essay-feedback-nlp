The voters of America do not vote for a president; they vote for a slate of electors who then elect a president. The Electoral College is the process of voters relying on a slate of electors to vote for the pesidential candidate of their choice, though they cannot always guarantee who the electors will vote for. The Electoral College should be changed to election by popular vote for the president because it is a non-democratic method since voters do not get to vote for a president diectly, even though the outcome is almost always in the favor of the voter.

The Electoral College is a non-democratic method of voting because voters only get to vote for a slate of electors, not the president of their choice. Although it is rare for an elector to vote for the president that is not the first choice of of the people who elected him, it has happened. The Electoral College is also unfair because in the system, the "winner takes all". This is unfair because nominees only spend their time campaigning in the "swing states" that will get them the most votes. In these states, some voters know they have no chance of getting the president they wish to elect if the majority of the state chooses to elect the other candidate.

The Electoral College is an unfair way of voting because citizens do not have a voice in their elcetion; can only hope that their elector votes for the president of their chioce. Our Senator should change to election by popular vote so that every citizen may have a vote!
