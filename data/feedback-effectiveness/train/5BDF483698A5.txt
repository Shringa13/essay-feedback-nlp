People can be Indecisive, It could be a decision between going on vacation with your family or helping your friend with something they're struggling with, or some other really difficult decision. When this comes up, people normally ask for help, but how much help do you need, and who should you ask?

Let's go back to the decision between the vacation or helping your friend. You probably shouldn't ask for help from your family or the friend that you want to help, because the answers could likely be biased to one side or the other.

What you should probably do Is either ask different friends or other students that have no bias towards your friend or family. Another great option can be family members that aren't going on the trip that again, you believe won't be biased.

Now that you have a decent Idea of who to ask, how many people should you ask? Well you can ask as many as you want, but I would recommend at least four to five people you know you can trust. If you only ask one person about something, what does that give you? How do you know If they're biased or not? Well, to answer those questions, It doesn't really give you much of anything If you only ask one person because someone can be biased, and you can't tell if someone Is biased toward something unless you can read minds, which you can't.

Deciding things can be very difficult, But If you were to ask a few trustworthy people, and know who to and not to ask without bias getting In the way, maybe It can be much easier to decide between the vacation with your family, or helping a friend out.
