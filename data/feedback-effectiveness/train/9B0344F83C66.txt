Now the fact is that the electoral college works well for our country, but when the population that is voting for president is actually voting for a candidate to vote for their state, that is lying to the voters and is morally wrong. We cannot lie to the population and be a strong country at the same time. We want to vote for our country's leaders not have someone else vote for us.

We have gone on long enough with the electoral college, it is outdated and inefficient. It dooes work to keep complications from arising in our voting procedures none the less. And I will admit regional preferance is also a huge problem. What if the Presiident ignores a certain region of the country in crisis? It is a risk we must take.

We are a country that has been falsely relying on the people and lying to their faces about it. I personally find it offensive, angering, and morally wrong. I do not want to see this atrocity being allowed to fester. In 2012 about one-half of the legal american voters took part in it, according to Richard A. Posner. That is millions, if not billions of people! All voting when their votes didn't matter.

"In 1968 a shift of just 41,971 votes would have deadlocked the election" according to Bradford Plumer. The electoral college is unfair, it has been proven.       Â
