Imagen this say a presidents term is up and your congress wouldnt you want a say in who you might work with or would you just have to keep up with two candites that you dontknow.

we as a nation should keep the electoral college vote heres why our founding fathers put that in the constitution,this makes congress think harder about this decison.

the founding fathers made that decision the hard way acording to the article the founding fathers put that in as a compramise what this means is they had to do a lot of work to set the system up the way it is its not right to just change the system like that and ruin their work, it has been that way for many years and it has worked alright look at jhon f kennedy we had the electoral colege system in place look how it turned out. Another example george washington look at him first president and his term turned out great so we had a bunch of sucsess with this system its not worth changing with the results it got.

this system makes congress think about its nominations for president for example the article said the electoral college consists of the selection for the electors this means congress hs some time to meet and think in wich to vote. the passage said the electoral college consists of 538 electors so this means they got to reach a consensus and with a concensus everything is put to tghought so the bad things of each candatite is put to tgought.

the passage did say the electoral college is unfair and outdadated but with the results we got from this system however the results have been great this means we had failures but we had some succsess so this system does work and when it does the results have been great. the article did say this winner take all system is unfair to voters but this system has shown great results with various presidints.

the system makes congress think and it has been put in place a long time ago by the founding fathers but it works so congress go look at some future candatites and vote for the best one, citizesens dont let the failures of this system persuade you to not vote go out there and trust the goverment we have gone this lets continue to move fowrward with our countrys economy and vote for the president.
