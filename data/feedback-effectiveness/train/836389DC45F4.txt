A letter to my principle

I think students shouldn't have cells phones at school because its an distraction to all of the students. But it will be different if the students were just a little quiet with the cell phones, but instead they decide to bring DRAMA to the schools. Cell phones are the number one reason why fights are getting started at schools around the country. If they didn't have cell phones the percentage of fighting and arguing will be decreased.

Also ,there's another reason I think they should ban the cell phones because if we were to use our cell phones in class the only thing that would happen is that no one will learn anything but how to TALK on the cell phone, and how to TEXT on the cell phones and that's mainly the problem that we are still having to today.

Next, is the drama it causes sometimes it can ruin an friend ship or even a marriage it can be that serious. But to lose an husband or an wife a family mmbe an best friend over some stuff like that is really childish and it needs to STOP before it gets out of hand. So that's it for WHY I THINK WE SHOULDN'T HAVE CELL PHONES AT SCHOOL !
