Dear. Mr. President,

I feel that we should change the Electoral collage to a direct vote. As the author states in source 2 "Under the Electoral collage system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors.." I believe the people should have a better say in who gets to run the USA. We should aboilish the electoral collage because people need to be able to vote for the president himself not his slate of electors. Also some electors don`t actually vote for who they are representing, And the electoral collage is just not fair.

The people should have a better say in who their president gets to be. They shouldn`t be voting for the Slate electors, but should be voting for the president. Sometimes the votes get overulled by the popular vote. The electors really only focus on the swing states. That`s just not right at all.

Belive it or not some of the electors dont even vote for the president they are representing. It doesn`t make any sense to do that. The electors should be voting for who they represent. That just increases my points value. The people should be able to vote for who they want.

The electoral collage is just unfair. The state legislators pick the electors, and some of those electors could always defy the qill of the people. It is unfair to the voters mainly because of the winner take all system, They mainly only focus on the swing states. Sometimes people get confused about the electors anf vote for the wrong canidate.

Many people can`t figure out if they want to get rid of the Electoral collage are keep it in place. The Electoral collage should be gotten rid of because the people should have a say, and some elecotrs are not loyal and can go agaisnt the will of the people. In the wise words of Bob Dole "Abolish the electoral collage!"
