I think policy 1 because at lunch all we doing is eating and talking at the table and we should be able to text not call people when we eating. An at free times we should be able to do anything. At least ever body is not doing with there class work. We should not just being doing nothing just staring at people talking loud missing other people work up. we should be able to text or call people in our free times. We should be able to listen to our music, play games, on our phones. An we changing class we should turn our phones off or put it on silent. Just in case.

If we wasn't allow to bring our phones to school. It we impossible to not bring it to school. Because what if is a emergency that one of your family members got hurt and your parents need you to be ready at the office. A sometimes we should not bring our phones cause somebody can steal your phone. An your phone can go off and u didn't know nothing about it and you can be tell the truth that u didn't know about it and they still don't believe you then a teacher or the principal can keep it, and you might have a conference with the teacher and the principal with your parents.
