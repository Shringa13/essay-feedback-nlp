TEXTING & DRIVING Texting and driving is not what we need and American. We as teens think it's cool to drive fast

And want attention and were not thinking about someone getting hurt. It's also we don't pay

Attention that's why we have the highest rate in Georgia. People are dying because they want

Their girlfriend/boyfriend to think their cool. We are also hurting ourselves by putting us and a bad

Crash we are getting hurt. People don't think about JAIL. You can lose your ID and paid money

Just for running over a red light not putting your seatbelt on. To prevent we need to make sure our

Phones are off while driving. Teens think it's cool when you drink and smoke and have to drive

Home if you are at a party and your friend drank too much and try to drive home Prevent it

Before she/he gets hurts and maybe die from a car crash.

Texting should only be for when you are just sitting and the car it's not on your and the parking lot

Waiting on your mom. Hats when its fine but when you are backing backed make sure you look

Both ways left and right, it's like when you walk across the street you look both ways How to

Prevent car crashing, you have to look for children make sure you drive slow by schools or

When you close it's going to say slowly down school ahead. Keep at least one hand on the steel

Wheel. Do not drive with no hands it not cool or safe it can put you and danger, Make sure you

Have your seatbelt you can fly out the window and die just because you didn't put your seatbelt

On. Be courteous to the other drivers no one on the roads. so you should treat people with

Respect.
