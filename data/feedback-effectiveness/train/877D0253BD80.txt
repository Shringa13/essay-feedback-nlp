Have you ever voted? do you thing you need to vote to be a good american citizen? if yes why do you think that? In my opinion i think there is a very good reason we should have an Electoral College. My reason for that is that the Electoral College process consists of the selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for president and vice president, and the counting of the electoral votes by congress. This is why i believe the Electoral College should continue just this little piece of information is all about organization, and organization alows us to get things done faster.

In paragraph 10 in the article "Does the Electoral College Work?" the author says "IF you lived in texas, for instance, and wanted to vote for [John] Kerry, you'd vote for a slate of 34 democratic electors pleged to Kerry." The author absolutely makes no point because you still are basicly puting in a vote for the president but just not directly. The Electoral CollegeÂ  is the way America organizes the voting system.

Alot of people are like theres no reason for the Electoral College to exist that theres no use when theres a mojority rule. Ask yourself this what if theres a tie we cant have two presidents at one time it would be an abomination. The Electoral College will basicaly be the tie breaker. They would be vote to break the tie them selves.
