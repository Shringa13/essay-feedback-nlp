The new software can make 3-D models based off your face, to be able to do this software need to have fine accuracy. the software could identify humans emotions, but should be used in some cases. As in making computer-animated faces more expressive for video games or video surgery. What they shouldnt be allowed to do, is to choose certein ads and tv shows based off your emotions.

The new software is a compter that can know someones emotions just baseed off of one photo, or painting. This compter has such fine accuracy that it can make 3-D animated faces by the 44 major muscles thats in your face. This compter can know weather if your happy, surprised, anger, etc. This makes it easier for game designers to create people with better expressive faces, can help with video surgery.

The desgners of the computer also want it to show peolpe ads based off the peoples emotions, weather if there sad, happy, mad, etc. This would make people more incline to buy something based off there emotions. Which shouldn't be allowed, beacuse the computer could take control over peoples wants and there needs based off there emotions. This also is a lake of privite life, meaning that, beacuse your computer is scanning your face to "finger out your emotions" it also have a copy of your face. Which if people can get a hold that, they would have personal info. For example, with the new Iphone X. you can unlock your phone by putting your camera towards face. so if you happen to fall asleep, someone could get a hold of your phone and unlock it by putting it towards your face.

In conclusion the new computer software is a great creation which could help with computer animation and video surgery. But shouldn't be allowed to be used for ads, to make people but stuff based off there emotions.
