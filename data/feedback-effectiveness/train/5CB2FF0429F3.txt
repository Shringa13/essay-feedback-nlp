The electoral college is a part of the constitution, it's has been used to decide who will be our president froever as long as the constitution has been on paper. Why get rid of it? Is it because we live in a world where everything is new and improved? Or because it geneuinly does'nt work? Electoral colleges are widely regaurded as an anachronism, and non-democratic method of selecting a president. So why do we need to cange the way we do things.

What if something tlike the disaster factor happened again and someone voted for someone that wasnt in their party. Or if an election came to a tie what would happen then the election would be thrown to the house of representitives, where the state delegations vote on the president, because each state casts only one vote ,the single representitive from wyoming, represents 500,000 voters. but the electoral college avoide run-off elections meaning no canidate recieves a majority of the votes cast. Another good thing about electoral college-
