Dear Principal,

I feel that community service is a nice thing to do in our community, but I also feel that you should not make children who do not have the time, or do not want to do community service have to. If a child is to do volunteer work I feel that the student should voluntarily volunteer not be forced to do something by a principal or a teacher. The student would probably not do a good job at what they were doing if they did not want to do it. For example if a student was to tutor a child from an elementary school and they did not want to they might tell the elementary student the wrong answers on purpose because they do not want to be there. I believe that the children in our school have the knowledge to know when community service should be done. I feel that this is a great school, and I enjoy learning here, however I do feel that you should not make children do something that they do not want to do. As long as you have the proper tools to let the students at this school have a chance to do community service I believe that several of them will take that opportunity. I suggest that you put brochures in the office for tutoring sessions, trash pick up, paper routes, and any other form of community service you can think of, so that children will have the chance to do some community service. If not a lot of children in the school take this opportunity then I recommend making community service a requirement to go to this school. Thank you for taking my judgement into consideration.

-Sincerely,
