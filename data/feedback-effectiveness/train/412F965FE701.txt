Informing fellow citizens about the advantages of limiting car usage. In paragraph three it state, "As a result, 70 percent of Vauban's families do not own cars, and 57 percent sold a car to move here. "When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way," saide Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and mother of two, as she walked verdant streets where the swish of bicycles and the chatter of wandering children drown out the occasional distant motor." What this statement is saying is that if you do not own a car or those who have sold their car(s), life will propably be less stresstful. You won't have to worrying about wasting money that you can be using on food and things for your children, on gas. One less thing to worry about. This is one of many other advantages of limiting car usage.

In paragraph fourteen it states, "Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after five-days of intensifying smog...[The smog] rivaled Benijing, China, which is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world." This statement means that car traffic has gone done in a big amount of percentage, not only in the capital of France but in cities of big population. This one other advantage of limiting car usage.       Â
