I feel like it should and here's why. First of all what happen is someone is depress and dont want to tell anyone about it so they kill their self because they're depress the facial Action Coding System could have help that poor boy or girl because someone would ask her what's wrong and talk about it with him or her and know they feel that someone there for them and how much they're needed and wanted so they don't kill there self matter as fact there are happy right now because someone is there for them and they feel wanted and they can love life agian. My evidence why I wrote that satatment is the passage it said "she's 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted,6 percent fearful,and 2 percent angry" I think everyone should have this because it could save a lot of people lives because so many people take their lives away so fast and young because of depresion and lot are teens if high schools and jr high haves these i feel like it would change the world for the better. Some peolpe don't like it mabye it's because they're the stress ones that need help and think that no one cares and is to scared to show they're depress and they rather keep to them self. My oppoion is that every school and family doctor should have this to save lives and more.
