dear senator i think you should just keep it the same because then people will get confused. If you change to election by popular vote people will just be confused. according to artcile 1 elctoral college consist of 538 electors. and a majority of 270 elcortal votes is required to elect the president. According to 23rd admendment of the consititution the district of columba is allocated 3 elctors. each canidate running for president in your state has his or her own group of elctors. they can be either deicranditate or republic.

According to the second artlice under the elctoral college system, voters tates vote for one person thevote not for the president. in second passage it says the single best agrument against the elctoral college is what we might call disator factor. in artilce 2 it say at most basic level , the elctoral college is unfair to voters. so with that being said i think i would be against colloege elctoral because it is unfair. why would u agree with a thing that is not fair. the elctoral college is unfair, outdated,and irrational. so thats why i would not choise elctoral vote. in the 3 section it shows the number pf votes given to eah state. not ever state gets same number of votes as others some only have couple of votes. to me i thi nk each state shoukld have same amount of vote so its fair .because if all big so then it would be unfair.
