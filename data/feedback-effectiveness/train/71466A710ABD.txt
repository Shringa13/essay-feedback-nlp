to the principal

YOU HAVE A POINT HERE

to not allow students to use cell phone on school grounds but i think we should be allow to cause what if your sick and no one around to see u or nothing and you pass out.

BUT

some people will text in class and u guys wont know so i thing there should be cameras in all classroom. policy 1. BECAUSE i choose policy one is because we understand the rules here and cell phone would be okay to texting on lunch periods only not in class it will make the teacher mad and yell at you if your phone on in class u can turn your phone on but turn the ringer off when your in class.

and policy 2 i don't under stand why u guys don't allow in on school grounds when you know people will still do it and they would be talking dirty on the phone so u need more people watching around the school.

we need 3 secrity guard watching the school too not only one.
