In this essay of the Electoral College it is questioning to see if the Electoral College realy works. In my point of view I think that it does because it gives certain reasons to show it does and if it didnt work the would've changed it a long time ago so it shows you that it work and thats why its still around until this day. The Electoral College is a process , not a place. The founding fathers establised it in the consitution as a compromise between election of the president by a vote in Congress and election of the president by a popular vote of qualified citizens.

One of the reasons i think that the Electoral College actually works is because The Electoral College works is because it process consists of the selection of the electors where they vote for President and Vice President, and the counting of the electoral votes by congress. The Electoral College helps pick the president and vice president and if didnt have that then it wouldve been total chaos because with The Electoral College it is way easier and faster and is a better process , The Electoral College consists of many electors and electoral votes this is really important because under the 23rd Amendment of the Constitution, the District of Columbia is allocated 3 electors and treated like a state for purposes of the Electoral College. For This Reason, in the discussion the word state also refers to the District of Columbia.
