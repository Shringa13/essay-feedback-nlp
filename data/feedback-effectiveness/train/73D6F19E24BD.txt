The students are very mad that the principal is considering that you have to have a b average instead of having a c average to play sports or other activities. At the school so I think you need to do good in school to play or do school. stuff or you can talk to the principal and try to change his mind and get people to play, or you can talk to the teachers and get them to change his mind that will work to he mite do it and he mite not any way you tried to get him to change his mind or if you do good in school that mite do the trick to. If you do not change the policy i will not do any work at the school and we will be arguing about this. Do not think we will let this go we will not.
