Decisions are a big deal but how do you know you are making the right decisions? others can help a lot by giving you advice but you also always need to make sure that you are talking to the right people and make sure they are giving the best advice to you.

Asking for advice is always a great idea if you are stuck with a decision.

first of all, you have a better chance of making the better decision when asking others for advice on your decision. When you only ask one person you only have one piece of advice but when you ask multiple people you have multiple ideas like if you ask three people fro advice and one person says one thing and then the other two have the same idea then you would go with the two people with the same idea because they have the advice that the majority agreed on. you also get way more support when asking multiple people because they all want to help out with the decisions you make. People will also push you to make the right decision when you are making big decisions like choosing your classes or what car you want to get.

Another big one is the people you talk to about your decisions. Teachers are really helpful when it comes to making the right choices because they are with you very often and are very nice and supportive. Parents, siblings, and other family members are also very good for your choices because they are always very supportive of you no matter what. Friends are another big one because they are your friends so they are always there for you no matter what, at school at home they always support you.

those two reasons are why asking multiple people for some help on choices is a smart thing to do.
