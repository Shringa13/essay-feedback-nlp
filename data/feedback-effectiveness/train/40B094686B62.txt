Dear President of the United States,

I think you should change the whole "

Electoral Collage

" and have election by a popular vote instead. It would make much more scence instead of the whole Congress blah, blah, blah, and stuff. I mean I know that this was created by our Founding Fathers and should show respect, but popular voting won't take as long and much faster too. It states that in the article on paragraph 3, the first sentence , "

The Electoral College consists on of 538 electors

". Thats a lot of people. But when people try to vote for you, they are actually voting for the candidate's electors.

"

Under the Electoral Collage System, when voters vote not for the president, but for the slate of electors, who in turn elect the president. If you lived in texas, for instance, and wanted to vote for [John] Kerry, you'd vote for the slate of 34 Democratic electores pleged to Kerry

" (

Par. #10, Sent. #1-2).

"

The Electoral College is what we might call a disastor factor. The American people should be lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in the century; the system allows much worse

" (

Par. #11, Sent. #1-2

). That is why I suggest making a popular vote in stead.

Sincerely ,

PROPER_NAME
