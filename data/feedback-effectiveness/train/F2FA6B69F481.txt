Phones and driving

I think people should and shouldn't use their phones while driving. I think people who drive and pay more attention to their phones should be arrested and have their lisecen taken away because the could cause crashes , deaths and traffic . the most common death in America is car crashes because of stupid drivers and people looking at their phone while driving. Now the reason I say people should have their phones is in case of emergency like if they get in a car crash or if they have to call 911 to help someone. in the u. s. it is a law that you have to have your phone down from your hands while driving or at least have a Bluetooth device that can connect to your phone to your car so you don't have to look at your phone to call or answer a call while your driving a car . so I'm both with and against with this argument about if drivers should and shouldn't have their phones while driving
