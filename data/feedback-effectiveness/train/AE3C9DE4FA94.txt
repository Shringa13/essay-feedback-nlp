I'm in favor of kipping the Electoral college that to the fact that keep out problems andÂ  its fare to evry one. In the text state that ''The electoral college consists of 538 electors. A majority of 270 electoral votes is requiered to elect the president.'' that shows that the popular vote is the one who wins. Also, In the article says ''The college avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate recives a majority of the votes cast;''And is tre because without the electoral college it will have a lot of candidates that they will not get a majority of vote nether one.

by the way, a dispute over the outcome of an electoral college vote is possible and it hat happend before but it's less likely than a dispute over the populat vote. Voters in presidential elections are people who wants to express a political preference eather than people who thinks that a single vote may decide an elections
