Does we are really voting for the elector or someobody else?, sometimes elections can be unfair but one of the best methos and the one more easily to understand and fair is by electing the president by popular vote.

To beging with,every state should be treatly the same, have the respect campaings and no one state should have advantage or disadvante at the time of voting because sometimes representatives can give a advantage or a disadvantage and sometimes can give a catasrophic decision, but also more power for bigger sates that represents 35 million voters like california."given that many voters vote one party for president and another for congress, the House's selection can hardly be expected to reflect the will of the people".

other example of this can be seen in te elections of 2000,"seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all, including rhole island and south california,and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didn't get to see a single campaign ad. And this just show how when we have electoral collegue can be a disadvantage for candidates, if they know they are not going to win they don't focus on those states,and some people who want to have more options or listen to other persons they cant because they dont see a campaign to convice them.

In summary,its better to the winner to take all cause almost half of the population agrred with the candidate thinking and maturity to select whats best to others,but also whe you are voting fot the state elector you cant control their final vote and sometimes you don't choose who you is your state elector and you don't now if he has the best wisenes to decide,if two presidents in popupal vote get close that mean that  a lot of people agreed with the same person,but that doesnt happen when we have electoral because its just a minimum number and we dont now if everybody in the state really agreed with the representator.

To summarize,if we want a fair election and be part of it, listen to others options, have part of the the decision of our president , and be trheated the same and the our vote really counts we should elect by popular vote.
