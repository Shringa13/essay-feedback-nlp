The electoral college is described in many ways. It is described as needed, useful and helpful. I think it is described as unfair, outdated, and irrational. I describe it this way because majority votes do not really "count", has been used for three hundred years, and it is just more time taken to vote for our president.

To kick it off, the electoral college is unfair in many ways. When we vote for our president, our votes don't exactly count. We just vote for representatives to go vote for the president. Many people would have won by majority vote, but the electoral college had more votes for the other side.

Continuing on, the electoral college is very outdated. The Founding Fathers used it when they were alive. I think that America is a little past that, because that was three hundred years ago. Why still use something that old? It is pretty irrational to still use the electoral college.

Finishing off, the electoral college is very irrational. It makes no sense to have a process that long to do a somewhat simple thing. Even other Americans believe that the election should be based off of majority vote. Sixty percent of them believe that to be true! The electoral college is a waste of time.

All in all, the electoral college is just a waste of time, and process. It takes to long for the president to be voted in. It also makes no sense because our votes dont even count. Most of us believe it should go away, by majority vote,too.
