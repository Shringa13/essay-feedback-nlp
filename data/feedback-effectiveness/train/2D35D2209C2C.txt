The way that i see it is that the author put a lot of reseach into venus and study it some scientist still today though study the plant. And trying to find a way to go there but the tests that there getting back isnt good like how in the article it said that "no space craft survived the landing for more than a few hours ".

So as there doing more tests they find out more things about the plant and try to look for a way to reach venus and to finally land on it . And to find out more stuff about venus up close .

The other thing is they found out about venus is that " a thick atomsphere of 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets venus" according to the article . And so that means that they also have to find out whats wrong with the air and how can they live in it . And venus it the hottest plant even though mercury closer to the sun so it means that venus wont really be safe for us .

But therefore scientists cant get close to venus cause of the plants but they will try to chance even though there a risk. They still though want to so that they can test the objects on the plant . And see if its safe for the future or something .
