Dear state senator,

You seriously need to change this whole "Electoral College" voting system. It's not right and not accurate. Wouldn't it be fair if the people had a say in this? We..The People?

Popular vote definetly makes more sense in this case. It's proven that an electoral vote would sometimes end in a tie, resulting in a "You're President, You're Vice President" scenario. No one wants to go through a tie cause the election would go to the House of Representatives and then they would decide who is who. That's pretty stupid...if I do say so myself.

Now if the people, us, had a say in this...Then we'd defiently have a winner. No ties, No mistakes, No nothing. Just a plain, clean winner. The electoral college is unfair to voters to be honest. The electoral college is irrational, unfair, outdated and annoying. No one uses it anymore. Due to it being completely unfair to citizens and states alike.

The Electoral College rule says "It requires a presidential canidate to trans-regianl appeal." Don't you think we know that? Then there's the fact that only "Big States" have a say, what about the smaller ones? There are people there too you know.

The Electoral College does avoid the problem of "Run-Off Elections" but that doesn't help the fact that we should all have a say.

Well, Nevertheless, you can understand why im so fed up with this "Electoral College" nonsense. It's stupid, outdated, and unfair.
