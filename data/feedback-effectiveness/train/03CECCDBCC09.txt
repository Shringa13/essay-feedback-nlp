I dissagree with the fact that the state wants to keep favor of electoral college. I think they should change the way the whole election is set up by using popular vote for the presedent of the united states. To me the election should be based on what the people wants and what they think is best not on electoral college. Electoral vote is also unfair to the people who vote because of the winner-takes-all system is certain states.

Yes richard nixon, jimmy carter, bob dole, the u. s chamber of commerce, and the AFL-CIO agreed on electoral college but electoral college is when the voters vote for the state electors who the vote for president. there is an arguement called the disaster factor also and thats the single best argument against the electoral college. Thats why popular vote for president is better than electoral because there is a better possibility of the majority of people winning.

The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational it officail !!!. Also arguments against direct elections are apurious at best. Bob dole was right:abolish the electoral college.
