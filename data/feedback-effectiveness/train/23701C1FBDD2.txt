I claim for the value of using this technology to read students' emotional expressions. To support the claim here's to esamples, one it carries code to help it detect certan emotions in the human face, and two according to the Facial Feedback Theory of Emotion, moving your facial muscles not only expresses emostions, but also may even help produce them. That's my two reasons why I support the technology to read students' emostional expressions.

One it carries code to help it detect certan emotions in the human face. Also the code can be kept for years, and would only need to to updated so we won't need to have multiple people tring to tell others how their facial expressions tells hows they are feeling.

Two according to the Facial Feedback Theory of Emotion, moving your facial muscles not only expresses emostions, but also may even help produce them. A esample of this would be the classic of "put a smile on your face".

In conclusion, I claim for the value of using this technology to read students' emotional expressions. To support the claim here's to esamples, one it carries code to help it detect certan emotions in the human face, and two according to the Facial Feedback Theory of Emotion, moving your facial muscles not only expresses emostions, but also may even help produce them.
