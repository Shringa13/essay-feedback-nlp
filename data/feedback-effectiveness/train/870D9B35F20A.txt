I'm wanting to keep the Electoral College because it comes in handy in our system for voting. They can help us break a tie between two competing candidates that want to become presidents of the United States. You may not think its a big deal but it is. I don't like the "winner-take-all" system, I find it unfair that the president can automatically win a vote from one state. They need to get use to the voting system instead of winning one automatically. The one thing I like about the voting system is that people can pick who would be the best candidate for our nation. For example, I find it a terrible mistake that people picked Obama and all the stuff he had promised in the pass and still haven't kept his words. In my opinion, I think Obama daughter can build a better system than him. It whatever though, it the people choice that they want Obama to be president of the United States. I just think he just a liar to our nation. Now back on to the subject, the Electoral College can be important to the system. The bad side of the Electoral college is that under its system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who turn elect for the president. The singel best argument against the electoral college is what we might call the disaster factor. Us Americans should consider ourselves lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century; the system allows for much worse. Consider that the state legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors, and that those electors could always defy the will of the people. If you don't like my opinion, then make a new system that is close enough to be a consensus.    Â
