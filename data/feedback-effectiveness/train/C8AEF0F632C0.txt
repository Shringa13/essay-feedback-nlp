TEACHER_NAME

I think policy 1 is the right policy because three reasons why is its not disrupting class, emergencies , and let us have some fun for once . I also thinks its time for a change and I believe that this will bring up students grades. So let us have cell phones.

Now the main concern I know you are worried about is class being disrupt well if there turned off in class how can class be disrupted? As policy 1 requires only use cell phones during lunch and free time that means the teacher is not teaching class when we have our cells phone out. And if a phone does go off in class take that students phone away not everyone's. That's just the first reason why policy 1 is the best.

Next this brings me to is emergencies. I feel that if 20 students in a class has a phone and a intruder comes at least half the students can call 911. Also if a student is sick just tell the teacher to use bathroom where the student can call him/her parent , instead of having to fill out a slip to the nurse and its not disrupting class. Now TEACHER_NAME

that sounds good.

The last reason policy 1 is good is because we need to have fun. All we do is work all day and never have a break unless you have physical education. Also students will be way more happier and would want to go to school to learn instead of being bored half to death.

So that's the last reason why policy 1 is the best.

Now that you have read this I will like you to think about policy 1 and how different school will be. From not disrupting class, emergencies, and letting us have some fun. Now you think about how school will be after that.
