This is my deatlis to back the witer on his claim how how studying venus is both worthy and dangerousand to explain how the author backs himself up on his claim. He gives alot of good points but a huge point that stood out to me was wehen he said how venus is sometimes called Earth's twin becuase in distance venus is the closest planet to us in denstity and size so pretty much Venus is a mini Earth. Another thing that the author toched on is that Venus nickname The Evening Star the writter put that piece of info about Venus becuase he is explaing how Venus is one of the brightest points of light in the night sky which makes it simple for anyone to spot even a simple stargazer. The last point of evedince the writter used to suppports his claim is the dangerous part oif hsi calim he said that NASA has been studying how they are goinhg to send humnas to study VEnus but the dangerous part of that mission is the surface conditions.
