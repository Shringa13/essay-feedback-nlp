I think that the electoral college should stay, because the electoral college is a process that with help our country and future problems. most states have a winner-take-all system that awards all electors to the winning presidential candidate. After the presidential election, the governor prepares a certificate of ascertainment listing all of the candidates who ran for president in the state along with the names of their respective electors. the state's certificates of ascertainments are sent to the congress and the national archives as part of the official records of the presidential election.

The electoral college consists of 538 electors. each candidate running for president in the state has his or her own group of electors. the electors are generally chosen by the candidate's political party, but state laws vary on how the electors are selected and what their resonsibilities are. The founding fathers established it in the constitution as a compromise between election of the president by vote for president and vice president, and the counting of the electoral votes by congress.

the electroal college is widely regarded as an anachronism, a non-democratic method of selecting a president that ought to be overruled by declaring the candidate who receives the most popular votes the winner. when you vote for a presidential candidate you're actually voting for a slate of electors. Each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee and that trust is rarely betrayed, however it is entirely possible that the winner of the electoral vote will not win the national.
