The policy of students not being able to participate in sports or other activities unless they have B average is a praiseworthy one because it encourages students to soar academically. First of all, those who desire to participate in extracurricular activities, which is a large portion of students, will be forced to try their hardest in school.

Putting one-hundred percent of their efforts into academic-related activities, such as studying for exams, doing their homework, etcetera, will help students in the long run.

They will get better grades, go to better colleges, get better jobs, and ultimately live better lives. This policy encourages this needed hard work in school, thus, is a commendable one. Second of all, students will better grasp the concept of responsibility. Responsibility is an essential factor of life, and needs to be encouraged as much as possible.

To have the responsibility of trying hard in school and getting better grades, is to value the future of oneself, others, and the world.

If schools support this idea of having the responsibility of getting good grades, then students will improve academically and intellectually.

In conclusion, the policy in question is plausible because would contribute to the betterment of the world and its people's lives.
