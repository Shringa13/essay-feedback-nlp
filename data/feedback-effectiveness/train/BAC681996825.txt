There are good benefits and bad benefits of not having a car. With your legs being your transportation to get around the city, allows you to get a new experience of getting around. But it can also be pretty nerve wrecking knowing you have to walk everywhere you want to go. But the more walking you do, the less money your spending. Having no worries about paying for gas, car notes, tickets, etc.

Another good thing about not having a car is staying in shape. Walking around to get to where you need to go would get you more than plenty excerise. Nothing like having a nice healthy body, burning calories, and even pounds. Having nice strong and healthy heart and burning off the fat that you put on by doing nothing and being physically active by walking.

Less accidents, car jams, traffic problems, and even car polution. What parent doesn't want a cleaner air for there children to breathe? Less cars can somehow lead to an safer enviornment. Less car accidents dealing with people texting and driving, which could lead to less possiblities of death maybe.

No one wants to walk everywhere their trying to go, nothing wrong with going for a nice bike ride there. Limiting car usage can maybe differ the world, cause less problems, less worries, and the best of all. . . SAVE MORE MONEY!
