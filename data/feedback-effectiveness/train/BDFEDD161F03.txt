I think they should keep the Electoral college because what's the need of changing it if it was the same way back in the day. I could be wrong but i also think many things shouldn't change like trying something different whether it's new or not. many things shouldn't change just because it feels right or it may help with your problems because 9 times out of 10 it may go all wrong when you try it but all worked out in your head perfectly. The electoral college consists of the electors where they vote for president and vice president and the counting of the electoral votes by congress. the electoral college consists of 538 electors but a majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the president. And in my own personal opinion i think there's absoulutely nothing wrong with the electoral college i think it gives good advice and helps motivates you. the winner take all method of awarding electoral votes induces the candidatesÂ  to focus their campaign efforts on the toss-up states are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign. I sometimes think many people are aganist electoral college because the way it seperates the votes and only half will be required to go to the election and be seen. And others may have their opinions on this but it's ok to have your own opinion also different opinions don't hurt nobody it's just that different people believe in different things.
