Driverless cars have a positive and negative aspect to them. Here are a few positive aspects of driveless cars. Driverless cars have the ability to help a driver when coming too close to a car which is called a sensor. Sensor help drivers know when their to close to a car or any object that may put your life in danger. Another positive thing about driverless cars is that keep improving for example in paragraph 7 the 2013 BMW announced a system called "Traffic Jam Assistants." Traffic Jam Assistants allows the car to handle driving functions like accelerate,steer,and brake by themselves. It allows the driver to know what they need to do to be in a safe postion. Driverless cars can make you think about the "What Ifs," like what if something goes wrong with the technology and it puts your life in danger or others. Who fault is its yours or the cars? Driverless cars have negative aspects to them too because their not truly driverless as said in paragraph 2. Driverless cars may seem like their great but they have disadvantges that you should consider for not only your safety but for others to.
