I feel community service is important. I feel community service is important because giving back to your community your family, neighbors and friends is the best thing you can do to make strong powerful relationships with your family. principle, i think students should have to do community service, i remember one time i got in trouble in school i had to do it i thought it was going to be terrible but after all it really wasn't that bad, i mean it was hard and long but all that worked paid off after it was over my teacher acted like it never did anything wrong because he knew i wasn't that type of child. If i never did my community service i would of have never gotten my respect back for only doing one thing wrong and if you don't have a good relationship with your teacher you will miss out on a lot of fun stuff while your class mates are having all the fun. The community service wouldn't be what all my classmates thought about it would take place after school like a program you would go around with your friendly class mates in groups pick up trash that your find around your community. I would think of this program as a privilege instead of a horrible thing. Thank you for considering my opinion about community service.
