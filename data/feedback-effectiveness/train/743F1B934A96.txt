Electoral college should be changed to election by popular vote for the president. Because of electoral college electors tried changing votes in favor of the opponent because sometimes they werent located where they wanted to be. Passage 3: In defense of the Electoral College states that the electoral college is a non democratic method of selecting a president that ought to be overruled by delaring the candidate who receives the most popular votes the winner. On passage 2:The indefensable electoral college says under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of the president.

Electoral college should be replaced withe the election by popular vote for the president because electoral college is causing to much crisis. For example, on source 2: The indefensible electoral collegeÂ  says that if you lived in Texas and you wanted to vote for John Kerry, you'd vote for a slate of 34 Democratic electors pledged to Kerry even though you are not voting for electors just for John Kerry. Electoral college makes you or forces you to do things you arent aware of.

If electoral college replaced with the vote of the President i'll find it pretty fair because I dont think the President of the United States is going to cheat on the election of the electors. Every vote should be fair. Since electors can be anyone the electoral college process seems unfair to me. on source 2 says that the best argument against the electoral college is what we might call the disaster factor. People should be fair when voting.
