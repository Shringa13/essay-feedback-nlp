If they go by Electoral college then Congress would have to count up all the votes. The Electoral Cpllege has as many as 538 electors, 270 votes will determine who becomes our new president. On the other hand changing to election by popular vote for president will give people a chance to choose there favorite canidate to become the president. Its basically like picking favorites you get to pick who you think is best and who you want to become the new president of whatever you the situation may be.Â  Electoral College your not really voting for a president your votins for a slate of electors. Who really chooses the presidents ? That would be the electors who actually pick the president not the people. Mainly if you win the Electoral vote you still have to go through the popularity voting comes after that. Electoral College avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate reciaves a mojority of the votes that are cast.
