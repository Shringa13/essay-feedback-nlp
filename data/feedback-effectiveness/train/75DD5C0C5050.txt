In the article "Making Mona Lisa Smile", Is about technology being able to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable. And I am arguing that it is valuable. Because it is a better way for humans and computers to communicate better. The computer can tell if you are happy, suprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness for example your orbicularis oris around your mouth tightens your lips to show anger. It is also vauluable because it can show your real emotion in a picture too.

So if any student wanted to know how the author was feeling at the time and it could also help them with projects. It also know what ads you want to see like if you smile on a ad that you are watching it will bring up another similar ad. But if you are frowning it will bring up a diffrent ad. Another way it help is that the computer knows when a student is becoming bored or confused, then it could modify the lesson for the students. And it also has good animated faces and more expressive for the video game.

Which could help students in there career if they chose that profession.

It can even indicate a real or fake smile. And if you practice smiling and frowning it helps you create diffrent emotions like empathy feeling someone elses emotional state. But who woulve known a computer can do all of those things.
