If I was working for NASA and l had an argument with a person that believes that ''the face'' was created by aliens, I would say that it is just a simple landform that was made on mars. I say this because if I were to work for NASA I would look back at data that will help me defend my answer, that ''the face'' was not created by aliens. For all we know it could just be a mountain that has ''eyes'', ''a mouth'', ''and a nose'' due to shadowing.

We human beings really have no clue if there are aliens or not, we find ''clues'' and believe there are but, in my opinion there are none. In the article Mr. Jim Gavin said ''It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho''. This is what I would say if I had a discussion with a person who believed ''the face'' was created by aliens.
