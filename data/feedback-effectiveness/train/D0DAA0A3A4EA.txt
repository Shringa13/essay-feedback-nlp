I will be talking to you about how scientist's are thinking of putting things on the planet Venus and i wll also talk to you the fasinated thing our planet Venus has to offer. Let's get started shall we.

Well Venus is sometimes called a Evening Star. It's so bright that young stargazer would be able to find it. Venus is very hard to get a good look at, it's the second planet from the sun. It's name can be misleading, and the planet is refrred to earth as our " twin" plaents. We haven't been able to send a spacecraft over there yet because of the fact that the stuff we send over there are not able to survive for less than an hour. Scientist's have onle been able to send robots and teven they can't find a safe landing sight.

The clouds on Venus very corrosive since they have sulfruic acid in them. The air is also 97 percent carbon dioxide. The planet also has the hostest surface, it's tempurature can reach 800 degrees Fahrenheit. The atmospheric preasure is also 90 times greater than Earth's, but despite the planets dangers it would be a worthy pursuite. For example the planets atmospheric preasure is so strong that it crush a submarine that can go into the deepest part of the ocean.

Scientist's are fascinated by the planets Earth-like apperence. They think that long ago there use be a form of life that could have been very much Earth-like. The main reasonfor why astronomer's are so fascinated by Venus is because it looks very much like Earth. For example it has valleies, river bank's, and even mountains. Scientist's are thinking of sending a blimp like aircraft that can fly or hover at least 30 if not higher miles the planet's surface. The tempurature would range around 170 degrees Fahrenheit. The best part would be that there is plenty is solar power.
