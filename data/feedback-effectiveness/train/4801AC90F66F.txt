" Attention students, participate in at least one extracurricular activity," said my principal. '

"One of these days again?" "I hate this school, we do this every week." Generic_Name why do you like doing this so much?" "Hes letting us play sports, work on the year book, and even have free talking time." Generic_Name said. Out of nowhere,

"Generic_Name and Generic_Name come here!"

Me and Generic_Name looked at each other and said 'where in trouble' We went to Mr. Generic_Name Office and he asked

"are you boys going to do any activity's?' We were shaking harder than ever. "Yes sir "Generic_Name said, Me and Generic_Name headed to the basketball court and there were no ball's, "its Generic_Name" I said, Generic_Name was very mad, "Im done getting bullied by him!" "We have to confront him Cory." "OK lets do it" I said.

"Are you sure you want to do this Generic_Name?' "Yes I will not getting bullied by him again." We walked up to him, "give us a ball Generic_Name" he laughs "play me for one." "OK two on one." Generic_Name said,

"OK nerd" with a smile on his face. Generic_Name gets ball first, game to five

First possession Generic_Name loses the ball I pass to Generic_Name and he hits the three,"score two to zero Generic_Name" i said. " Yeah yeah play ball" Generic_Name hits me for a layup, but Generic_Name was too fast we kept passing back and forth until Generic_Name got tired. A loud noise I heard before I shot, I turned around and seen Generic_Name passed out on the floor. "Generic_Name did we go to hard?" i asked, "No he got what he deserved."

Generic_Name said

We went to Mr. Generic_Name office and told him what happened and

I was shocked. He is suspending us for seven days so i said, "I dont like fun Friday Because something bad is always happening just take it out!" "I'm trying to do nice things for the school its better than sitting down and doing work on Frid-" "No its not I will rather do work!" "Generic_Name do you agree with me?" "No" said Generic_Name "I like doing fun Friday better than doing work just like Generic_Name said,you are a nerd." I left the office and went to the bathroom and cried. "Its OK all of us have friendship problems" "Generic_Name is that you?" "Yes, i'm sorry about all them years ago when i bullied you and Generic_Name." i thought thats what a friendship was," in a sad voice. "Can we be friends?" he asked. "Yeah we can" i said with courage.

Me and Generic_Name went back to the office and I said my apologies to Mr. Generic_Name and Generic_Name." I guess fun Friday's are not so bad after all." 'I will unsuspend you guy's time, and keep you in school'" said Mr. Generic_Name. I now know to agree to this idea and respect my principal choices and rules. Generic_Name, Generic_Name,and I went to go do year books and our name's and picture's were together like our friendship was meant to be. I learned that doing activity's can bring you together with so many people its basicly changing how we act around or with others.
