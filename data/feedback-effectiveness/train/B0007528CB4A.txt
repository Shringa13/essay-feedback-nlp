Venus is gonna take Earths stop?

Is Venus worth the risk to explore? maybe so. Venus has so many things to offer, evening star, many out of the world features, and a thick atmophere. Doesn't mean we should kill ourselves trying, I think venus is not worth the try.

First and formost, the evening star, is the brightest point in the sky. Venus also makes it simple to stargazing. Venus is the second planet and the next closest plant next to earth. Stargazing is all fun and games on earth, but if you go to venus you may burn.

Also, Venus has a very thick atmophere. It's almost 97% carbon dioxide blankets around Venus. On the planets surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees fahrenheit, and the pressure of the atomsphere pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on earth. These conditions are far more extreme than anything humans encounter on planet earth.

Lastly, Venus's light cannot penetrate the dense atmosphere, rendering standard forms of photography ineffective. Most importantly, reseachers cannot take samples of rock, gas, or anything else in that matter. Many people are working on innovations thta would allow our machines to last longer to contribute to our knowledge.

Venus should be left alone, just as we would want to be. Venus is a harm to all man kind who try and rescach on Venus. If it was a safe idea to go up there would have already done it by now.
