The President should be chosen by popular vote. By letting the people choose who sould be their President they are able to get what they want, not what Congress thinks they want.

The Electoral College system is old news and now that we are in 2015 there are all sorts of new things going on. The Electoral College system is just too much and seems like a hassle that can be made easier by having qualified citizens vote for their President.

Under The Electoral College system voters are voting for electors who choose the President for them. I feel that the people should be able to put in their votes and the man (or woman) who has the majority of the votes should be the President. I am aware that choosing the President is a big deal but by doing this, things are much easier and more efficent.

What I am trying to say is that the Electoral College system is way too flawed and complicated to be good for us. I feel as though the Electoral College system is unfair, and irrational. Electors have been known to refuse to vote for their party's canidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever. Richard Nixon validated only his oppenent's electors as well. People can take this system to advantage easily and obuse it to get what they want.

By choosing the President through popular vote it is very difficult to mess up the amount of votes for one person. You can keep supervision on the voting stands and make sure nobody puts in more than one vote for one person and also monitor the people who sort the votes. People are very selfish and only think of themselves and thats why you shouldn't have other people go and vote for the party's canidate. The Electoral College system was made when thinking out of the box wasn't a good thing. The Electoral College system is unfair for voters and outdated.
