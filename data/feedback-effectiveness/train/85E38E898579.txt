Venus is the second plant from the sun. People always called it the evening star because it is one of the brightest points of the ligth fromm the night sky when its dark, but the nickname was misleading because Venus was a plant. Venus migth be simple to see from the distant but safe vantage point of Earth, it has proved to be an veery challenging place to see much closer.

One thing about Venus that it is the closer to Earth in way like the density and size and sometimes occasionally up close in distance too. Earth, Venus, and Mars, these three plants are like right next to each other like they are friends or neighbors and other plants orbit the sun in a different type of speeds. The differences in speed is that, we sometimes closer to Mars and sometimes its Venus. Its like play musical chair, but the three plants goes in different speeds then each other. So, since Venus is sometimes right around the corner in space, humans have to sent numerous of spacecraft to the land on to Earth.

Each pervious mission was a failed mission because no spacecrafts survived the landing, not even a few hours. And, its because a thick atmosphere that was a big atmosphere of amost 97 percent carbo dioxide blankets Venus. What's even more of a challenge are the clonds of the highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere that maade the temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what they experience on Earth.

In conclucion, I think what the author study was good fact about the plant Venus.
