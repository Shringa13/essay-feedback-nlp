In my oppion they should use the Electoral college to desied who wins the Election.

They should always use the Electoral college because it wouldn't be fair if they went by the population of a state, just the simple fact that some states are more populated than other. For instance states like New York, Florida, and California are more populated than, states like Hawaii, Rhold Island, and delaware.

The electoral colleged should always be the proses they use to elected a President of the the U.S., in my opinion the electoral colleged not only right but fare. Its equal rights and justice.

The Electore college states that you live in texas it right to voted for your own candidated.

Or in any state that you live in.

The single best argument against the electoral college is what we might call the disaster factor. The American people should consider themselves lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisism in the century; the system allows for us much worse. Consider that state legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors, and that those electors could always defy the will of people. Back in1960.
