What if I said that there are computers that can identify students emotions during class, well if you thought that was fake its actually real! Recently we've made this new technology called the Facial Action Coding System that allows computers to show human enotions and even things like paintings. For an example we used this on a famous painting everyone has a least seen once in their ifetime, which is the Mona Lisa. It shows that she is 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry. Those are things that can be cool to find out but it can also can be really valuable in a classrom.

For a classroom it can valuable like after lunch every student must use it before starting class to check how they're feeing. It will very useful if a student is sad or angry percent is high. It can give the teacher a reasoning to go up to the student and ask, why are you sad or why your angry. It can be very valuable like if a student just went through a terrible situation and the teacher can try to help cheer them up. One downside is that it can give out a students business and if like a student is sad, it can become a joke to the other students and make that student even more sad. It also identify if your making a fake smile or not as it can tell by how you make your smile like, if you make a fake smile your mouth is stretched sideways, as in a real smile your zygomtic major(that begin at your cheek bonees) lift the corners of your mouth.

This technology might be seen as a joke, but it can be very valuable in a classroom. It would be helpful if classrooms to get a hold of it as it could benefit the students. Most students are not always happy in school and this technology can be the one to help that not be a case. Teachers can now help the students get even more smartier then they already are. Whoever thought a computer can be the one to help take your students to the top!
