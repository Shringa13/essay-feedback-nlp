Dear state senetor i am writing this letter to state my point of veiw on the Electoral Collage. First of all i would like to say that is to the people. Because the poplar vote dosent allways win it is in the hands of the Electoral Collage. so our vote is pretty much just a suggestion for them. In a article i read there was a short paragraph about what was wrong with the Electoral Collage wich was by Brandford Plumer. It talks about how under the Electoral Collage voters vote for electors but not the president.

Even though there is a great advantage there is also a great disatvantage to the system. I think that the electoral collage is vary unfair to voters as would most people if they knew they where voting for voters to vote for the president. May i state that it is vary outdated like lots of old things in amarica they are forggoten or we move on, but this is still a problem that needs solving. On that note i hope you take this letter into consideration and think about how this could help us in the future.
