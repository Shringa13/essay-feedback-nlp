The electoral college needs to be kept, it is the easiest way to vote for a presidential canidate. People may not like it because the people who are voting for a president really are not voting for the  president, their voting for the electors to vote for the president. Which makes sense, but the electoral college is simple and yet very reliable in many ways people dont see.

The electoral college is based of popularity in a state. I  can see why people dont like that because certain states like florida has the maximum of 29 electoral votes, but wyoming only has a maximum of 3 electoral votes. The presidential canidates look for states that have the most electoral votes, but they also need more votes than the other canidate so every vote counts.

Citizens may think that the canidates dont care about their state, but they do in more ways than you think. The electoral college has a requirement, trans-regional appeal, which means that a canidate is popular in a certain region of the U.S for example, Mitt Romney he was the most popular in the south in 2012's election. Romney did not canpain heavily in the south so he did not gain any electoral votes by increasing his popularity in the states he knows he would win in.

The electoral college is definatly something to argue about but in my opinion it should be kept. The Electoral college may seem a bit unfair but its also the most easiest desion making tool when it comes to electing. Its been around for years it would make no sense to get rid of it.
