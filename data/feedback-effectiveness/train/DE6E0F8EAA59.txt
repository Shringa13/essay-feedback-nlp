Have you heard about the face on Mars? If so it really isn't a face on Mars it's either a natural information or a alien artifacted. I'm going to tell you about what scientist think it is about another mission that got more pictures.

Scientist figured it was just another Martian mesa, common enough around cydonia, only this one had unusal shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh. Although few scientist believe the Face was an alien artifact, photographing Cydonia became a priority for NASA when Mars Gobal Surveyor arrived at the Red Planet in Sept. 1997 eighteen long years after the viking mission eneded.

Then Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera team snappped a picture ten times sharper than the origianl Viking photos. Thousnad of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on JPL web site, revealing ... a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all. What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa-landforms common around American West.

It really isn't a face on Mars it's either a natural information or a alien artifacted. All this information was from the Article and I believe that it is just a landform.
