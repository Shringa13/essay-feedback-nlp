There are many ways to limiting car usage it would be better for the enviorment put more cash in ur poket for useing less gas and it would be much safer for your if it gona have a cerfiu.

there is goods things about having a car like getting to places faster. If you dont have one you have to walk which means exersicse so youd be in better shape then in all the car riders. youd also have more money because with no car you dont have to buy no 40,000 parking spot or waste money on gass ever week and a half . youd e saving the enviorment by not realysing toxic fumes in to our atmosphere which creates global warning which mealts the ice in our poles and your basicly killing pinguens. dont be a pinguen killer.

i think if they were to put a cerfui on driving out at night time less bad stuff would happen let me explain my self. If i somthing were to happen to me like getting kid naped  and i dont retuen home by 3;30 yor gona knoe somthing is wrong and maybe it might even save my life.

then our goverment could make money by giving us tickets but hopefully its not a lot because ufortuanetly not every one has a little cash in there pockets like some of us do.

If in case it past the curfui and u need to get home you could just walk home or have the cops take you home beause all cops are free taxis. If you didnt know. its aslo totaly free. cops arnt just here to give you tickets.
