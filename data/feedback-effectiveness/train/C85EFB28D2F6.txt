dear principal, 2-7-11

The b average requirement should not be revised. These extracurricular activities should only be allowed for the students who try the hardest in their classes. Those students have earned themselves this and shouldn't share them with people that have anything less than a b average. This is coming from a middle school student who takes algebra 1 in 8th grade and is recommended for English honors for high school next fall. That isn't pleased with a single b in any class that gets straight a' s.

A c average is required at my school for dances and other privileged things, I don't really care that a person that gets c' s or b' s has the rights that I'm entitled to because i know that i am very highly over them in academics and especially all sports. I bet i will go to a d1 university hopefully at NOTRE DAME for a starting wide receiver or cornerback position. In order to go to that prestigious d1 university you have to have a 4.2 gpa and a hell of a top football player in the country.

from,
