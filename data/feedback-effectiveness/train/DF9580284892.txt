When people want to ask for ideas or advice, they sometimes go ask more than one person. Asking more than one person is better than asking just one person. If you ask one person for advice its not the best because you are only getting one idea. If you ask more than one person like 10 people than thats better because you have lots of different ideas and opinions. In my opinion asking more people is better because i get multiple opinions to help[ me make a better choice. If you feel comfortable asking just one person then do it, but having multiple opinions will help you make a better choice. So lets say you want to get advice on how to get a girlfriend. You go to your best friendsÂ house and ask him, hey whats some advice or tips on getting a girlfriend and he gives you some advice and tips. Then you go and ask your parents, elders, teachers, and more friends and they all give you a bunch of ideas and opinions on how to get a girlfriend. Those are my thought on why its better to ask more people than just one person.
