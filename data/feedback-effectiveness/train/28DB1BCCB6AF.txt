I agree on the position of having a system of communication for school work.

Now lets say If you can not go to school if you have let's say the corona virus, you can just have classes there in bed,on a couch,or the kitchen table just like you would be at school.

There are certain devices nowadays like a robot on wheels with a screen attached so the student could drive the robot carefully since it can go only less than 3 mph but can give the child the joy of video games from home and education they need.

Another way of how the students could "go to school" from home is a IPad face time the person who is at home IPhone could ping a call to every class based on the classes schedules.

I see these sort of devices extremely helpful to the community, Plus a huge benefit to the students since If they get the work done at home they could join the rest of the class with very little to no catch up time.

I once on a personal note, once had to stay home from school since I had the stomach bug the whole family In my home had, I had to get caught up so I used the Google classroom and electude websites that the teachers say to use at home, just in case you miss class due to viruses. Once I returned the next week I was caught up in my B day rotation classes and A days I was ahead of everyone else in Generic_School so I could work In the shop more than the others.

So note, If you are ever at home You may see if the school can provide the face time idea or just work in Google classroom or what ever website your class uses at home or If school or hospitals provides A robot for absentees for a day then all the better for the student and the parents.
