Well people should pick up litter and i am going to tell you why:

First when your community looks bad other people don't want to live in a bad looking community.

All students should take some part in preventing littering, but the principal should make a list of which group of people who should do it every week and not all students can take part in community service because of the fact that some students have some form of after school activities and sports.

Only those that agree to work in community service should do it.

If u do this every week we could get this community looking good in no time.

There should not be any elementary kids picking up litter on the side of the road only kids 13 and up should be picking up litter on the side of the road.

If some one gets hit by a car the parents could sue the school for making there child pick up litter.

That is the downfall of the subject because if a child gets hit the school would be responsible for what happens to the kid and the principal would have to tell the parents why their kid is dead.

That is all i have to say about the subject
