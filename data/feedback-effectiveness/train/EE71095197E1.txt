Imagine being able to detect what other people are feeling? She's 83 % happy,9% disgusted,6% fearful and 2% angry. How does this computer tell all this information if this painting was painted hundred of years ago?

I think it would be a great idea to tell how people are feeling. Because someone might be having a bad day and you might not know, but if you could read facial expressions you would know. This computer than could tell you how Mona Lisa was feeling is a 3-D constructer computer. In oreder for it to detect a painting,Picture, or even an actual person's face Right now it has to have all 44 muscle movements of a human. the only thing i'd change about this experiment is instead of making everything nowadays computerized and robotic why dont we do this with paper and pencil, collect data and figure it out,if it doesn't work on the first try then change your hypothnose and do the experiment all over again.

My final conclusion is that decoding people's facial expressions is pretty neat. It gives us a look at the past and present day of people's reactions and expressions. They also told us how to look in the mirror and dot eh 3 steps by yourself and see if you can decode your own facial expression. This article was pretty interesting and I would like to look forward in more details about this.
