Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I honestly think that student should be required to do community service. Students have enough time out of the day to atleast help an elderly person across the street. I help my mom go around and pick up trash every Saturday.

You know if we picked up all the trash we throw down we could have a lot of garbage. People around the community could help by atleast caring about others because it would just brighten up everyone's day. Students should have to say good morning and have a big smile on their face when they walk in the classroom.

I encourage my friends to be happy with everyone because they might need that person one day. Anyways if you really think about it we could make the world a better place, if we all stick together and help save the planet by doing the community services we are required. I think that the students today are worried about sports, and not being able to help the community because of these jobs. Helping the people in South Carolina is better than any sport or video game. Those things don't help our state become beautiful helping the community is.

It's sad when you see all that garbage when you go somewhere beautiful on vacation. It makes me not want to go anymore after that. So think about what we can do to make our community a better place by making the students clean up. T he world isn't going to get better by sitting down and watching tv all day. Next time you see a student litter make them pick it up and give them a warning about our safety. I don't want to wake up one day and be surrounded by garbage.

Thank You
