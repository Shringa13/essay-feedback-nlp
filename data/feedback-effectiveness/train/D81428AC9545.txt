Dear Principal,

I think that students shouldn't be required to do community service because there family might not have time or maybe there parents wont let them. I think it would be nice for some children to help out but they shouldn't have to. The children should not be responsible to take on actions on doing other peoples stuff because it might have not been them who either littered or did something that the person that did this action should be responsible for it. Children should only be required to do community service if they have served time in jail and is required by the law or they are doing it for a good cause like when they have to do it at there school so they are ready for college and have to learn what their life is going to be about. So that's some of the reasons why i think that kids shouldn't have to take on doing community service. Taking time to do community kind of takes away being able to be a kid because you don't really get to hang out with friends and family , you don't get to have your own time and you might not have time to do your homework and that might cause you to have failing grades which even takes away more of your privilege's to hang out with friends or have your own time so i think that being required to do community service shouldn't be allowed unless you have done something so that you have to do community service. All though community service looks good on your college application so children should try to participate with community service but shouldn't be required at least you should wait until the kids are a senior in H.S. to start require community service.
