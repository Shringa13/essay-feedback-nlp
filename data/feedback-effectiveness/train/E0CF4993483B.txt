In "THE CHALLENGE OF EXPLORING VENUS" the author of suggests that studys venus is worthy pursuit despite the danger it peresnts.

people say that venus is the twin to the earth you may agree and alot of people will but there will always be someone that wont some people call it the the evening star because its the only thing that will be shining in the sky they dont blevie that its a plante but the people that belive that is a plante often they say "often referred as earth's "twin," venus is the closest plante to earth in term of destny and size, and occasionally the closest in distance too" (pargraph 2). this shows that venus is the closest plante to earth as of looking and sistence.

venus is the only plante that scintest studyed to see if humans can live in it they tried everything to studie it if humans ca n breath in it but they only found the resultes when they stoped working on it because they couldnt understand it so they had to change the way they were going to send humans to venus so they just quit but they started studying some more stuuf coming up with names for it and stuff in the text it says "venus, sometimes called the "evening star"( pargarh1). this shows that that they came up with names for so people under stand what the star is.

the artecal shows you how people can make nothing into something even if they fail they still can gt something else right or make something even though they tried to do something else.
