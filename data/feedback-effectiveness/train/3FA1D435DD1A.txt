Changing to election by popular vote for the president of the United State is the best way to select the prisedent, because people has right to pick any prisedent for them selve.

popular vote for the prisident is fair way to vote, there's no cheeting.

I think that The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational.

The electoral college is unfair to voters, because winner got to take all system in each state.

it's also dangurios for all the people in US.

If the winner got to take all system in each state, then he able to do anything he/she wants.

It's like a disaster factor, and the system allows for much worst. and consider that state legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors. that those clectors could always defy the will of the people.

on electorall college system voters vote not for the president, but for slate of elector.

people vote for president, not for slate of elector!!!!

electoral college may cauge trouble, it may mess up the system,
