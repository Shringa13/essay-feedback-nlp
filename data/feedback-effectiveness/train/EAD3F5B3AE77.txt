Dear Principal,

Policy 1 i believe in cause everyone is already using phone during class or out of the class room even in lunch so policy 1 is better than policy 2.

The reason i pick policy 1 is people are using phone in school already and some times the teacher catch kids but some time they don't i don't know we like our phone so we maybe want to use our phone anywhere, any day, any time that why u should let us our phones during school time.

Second reason, i think it fair if we use our phones cause i bet all school in this world teacher use their phone that is a other reason. it unfair that the grow ups can but not us they need to do theirs job then if we need to do ours job and i hope you think about that to see us feel about it.

Third reason, kids get stuff done and they don't have nothing else to do instead let us use in that time and we will be little happy. To some kids even care about their phone cause they are business but when they a free time they maybe use their phone also kids are smart the teacher wont notice we are
