According to the article venus is dangerous, But scientist dont care. they are fascinated by Venus because it may once have been the most earth like planet in our solar system. Scientist has been sending spacecrafts on Venus but no spacecraft has survived the landing. Thats one of the many reasons why Venus is dangerous to mankind. But are them reasons going to stop Scientist ?

"The clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere." doesn't that sound cool? Yea it surely does but that is dangerous to mankind, Who would want to breath in acid? Venus has harmful sections that Astronomers are going to try and over come, they are going to expand their limits and try to learn more about whats in the atmosphere. According to the passage scientist has been testing a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus's surfce. It have lasted for 3 weeks in such a condition according to the passage. There has been many more projects. Astronomers are not going to give up. there going to try and fight/fix the differences and let nothing get in there way.

Astronomers curiosty is whats going to help us learn about things and planets besides earth. Woudn't you want to learn more about our world even though theres going to be a little difficutly during the way? Maybe one day scientist can overcome these small problems and learn more about the Atmosphere. I think Astronomers are going to take on that challenge. Remember anythings possible if you put your mind to it, and thats what Astronomers are doing.
