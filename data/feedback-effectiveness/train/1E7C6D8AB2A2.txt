Dear princpal i think that kid should be able to use there phone on there free time like lunch and then when its time to go back to class they will put them back up and that will be so that kids will not be running out the lunch room and going and the hall doing bad stuff they will be sitting down some where texting and then it will be less fight not saying that we have a lot but i think that it should be a catch to that showing that your grades must be 75%or higher then that then our kids will start getting all there work done they will be trying to get all A'Bs and thing like that all over a little phone can change a lot of things that can be good or bad so lets take and avenge of it and lets get all the good out of it why we can now so that it will no ? about it and we is starting to get bad you can tell us to put them up and do now bring them back out on more or we get them took up and we have to pay 10 to get them back 15 is to much its like you paying for half you bill. that what i think about it.
