Dear Senator,

I believe that we should not keep the Electoral College because i feel as if it would be easier for people to vote somore people would actually vote. I know the Electoral College was established by our fouding fathers, but it is time to tart with something new and for something new to be established. I would honestly choose the popular vote because it also puts a suspence on people about who will win. The Electoral College may be widely regrded as an anachronism but when we vote we do not vote for a presidential candidate we're actually voting for slate electors. The college does not have a democratic pedigree which is another reason why we should use popular vote. When i vote i like to know as soon as possible and i feel as if we had popular vote it would be faster to do. Opinoins may not be taken inconcideration but my opinion is strong that we should use popular vote i really feel like more people would come to vote if we used that. People may feel like the Electoarl College is too long of a process so they just say oh i dont have to go vote so im not going to. The Electoral College avoids elections but without them how would we know about our future president and how would we know whether or not the person would do a good job at running our country? Overall i will stay with popular vote but if they choose not to do it that will not stop me from voting to choose who will run my country and do a good job at it! i know that whatever desicion is made was for the best intrest for our country.11
