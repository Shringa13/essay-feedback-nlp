In "The Challenge of exploring venses " the author suggests that studying venus is a wrothy prsuit despite the dangers it presents. The author thinks studyinfg venus is a worthy pursuit because venus is the most earth like planent in our soloar system. "venus is the closest planet to earth in term of denstiy and size, and occasionaily the closest in distace too." the author belives one day that people cuold go there and vist and study on venouse more or maybey even live there, " imagine a blimp like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above the roiling venusian landscape. just as our jet airplanes travel at a higher ataltitude to fly over many stroms,a vehicle hovery over hovering over venus wuold avoid the unfriendly ground conditions by staying up and out their way"

But studying vesue is pretty challageing and dangeus because being able to study tha planent you have to be on it and that diffcult because " a thick atmousephere of almost 97% carbon dixide blankets venus. even more challenging are the clouds of hihly corrosive sulfuric acid in venuis atmoahere." and "since no spacecraft suurvived the landing for more then a few hours. maybe this issue explans why not a single spaceship has tuoched down on venus in more than 3 decates."

" noumerous facters contrirbute to venus's repuaton as a challenging planet for humans to study on."
