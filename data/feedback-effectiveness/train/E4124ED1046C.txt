Mars has aliens! Many people believe that the landform on Mars was created by aliens, but here at NASA we have found that landform was actually created naturally. The landform is referred to as a Martian mesa, which is common in the region of Cydonia, but this has shadows that make it appear as if the figure has a face. Since the discovery of the form, it has been in movies, books, and radio talk shows. Some consipiracy theorists say that the form was actually created by aliens, but why would we want to hide the fact that there is life on Mars when in reality it would benefit here at NASA. The landform is Martian mesa formation much like the Middle Butte in the Snake River of Idaho.

The Martian mesa is the term used for the landform. It is very common to find them on Mars in the region of Cydonia. The Martian mesa was naturally formed, but with its shadows, it looks much like a face. In 1998 Mars Global Surveyor was close enogh to actually see if there were any alien monuments and turns out that there wasn't any.

Here at NASA we recieved a lot of attention when the "Face" was discovered. If the landform was actually created by aliens, why would we try to hide it? The landform had no monumemts near it when looked at by the Surveyor. "Defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an ancient civilization on Mars." People wanted there to be something because it would benefit us.

In the end, the landform was found to be a Martian mesa. There are many mesa's in the region of Cydonia and that's a part of how we found out how it was a natural landform. Also the Surveyour verified that there wasn't any other monuments near the landform. If there was any life on Mars we would want to tell the people so they can be intrested in the activity at NASA, but for now there has not been found any life activiy on Mars.
