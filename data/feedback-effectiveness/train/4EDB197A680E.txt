A better idea for you change is that the students should have a C in the first semester to participate in sports and other activities. Then in the second semester the students must have a B to participate. One reason that the students should have a C to participate is because most of the students have a grade C average. It wouldn't be fair for most of the students to not be able to participate. Another reason is because if the students see how fun it is to be able to participate in activities and they find out that the principal is going to change the grade to a B then the students are going to want to work hard to get that B.

One reason why you should change the grade to participate in sports from a B to a C is because most students have a C. It wouldn't be fair for the students that have a C. This idea will only be for the first semester.

In the second semester the students will have to have a B to participate. By the time the students find out how much fun it is being able to do the activities there going to find out that the grade to play the sports and other activities changed from a C to a B. The students are going to want to work hard to get that B. The students don't want to lose that privilege to be able to do any type of activity.

Therefore, you should change your idea. The students should have to have a C to participate in the first semester cause it wouldn't be fair for the students that have a C. Then in the second semester change the grade from a B to C so that the students can work hard to get a B. This idea will help kids get a better grade, to learn more, and to be a better student.
