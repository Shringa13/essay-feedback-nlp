Dear Principal:

I think students must have a least a B average to participate in sports. That way the students can bring their grades up. A lot of students would want to bring their grades up because they would like to participate in sports. That's a way students can bring up their grades. Maybe the students can bring their grade up and that way the students can work harder in class.

That way students can work hard and participate in a sport that they deserve for getting good grades. This policy may work so students can bring their grade up and stop failing their classes. One way they can bring up their up and be able to participate in sports is by turning in there homework and completing their work in class.

Here at SCHOOL_NAME we have a policy that says " If you have more than three (F)'s you cant participate in a sport". That's why a lot of students try to get a good grade, and that's why the students turn in all their work, in order to participate in a sport. Their is a lot of students in SCHOOL_NAME that don't have good grades and cant participate i
