Why might spending time on a ship of animals be fun? Well there are many benifits of doing this act. At the same time there might be some small downsides to going on this trip. Like if you get sick easy you might not go on this trip. Before you decide let me tell you the highs and the lows of this.

Lets just get the not so good facts out of the way. If you are allergic to animals with fur or just animals in general this is not the job for you. Because you are going to be on the ocean, if you sea sick easy. Do not do this job. These are the down sides of this job, but the ratio of good to bad there will most likely be way more positives then negitives.

These are the terrific things about going on this trip. Well first of all you get to meet new people. Also you can get to know animals and lear ablout animals, too. So this will help you if you plan to work with animals when you grow up. You get to travel to new and incredible places that you haven't been to before. If that does not grab your attention then I still have more to tell you how amazing this would be! "The cattle-boat trips were an unbelievable opportunity for a small-town boy." Stated Luke. Luke had fun you would, too. If you think you had fun working with the animals on the boat, just think about what incredible things you do when you unload all the animals. Well I will tell you what they do. The cowboys play baseball, and volleyball, boxing, fencing, and so many other games when there are no animals on the ship. This is also a good time to get to know people.

So do you think that you are going to join now? All the games and fun you have. All the people you meet. It's amazing what you can fing on a trip like this. Isn't it? I think it's facinating what you will learn, see, do, and discover. I will leave the chose up to you now.
