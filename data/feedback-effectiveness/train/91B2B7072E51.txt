Should we have a facial action coding system for schools?

I do and do not think we should. First off I think it would not be a good idea because it's gonna distract the teachers. All the teachers are gonna be worried about how the students feel. Some students do not like talking about their problems at school. The teacher is already gonna know the students emotions before they sit down in their desks. I wouldn't want my teacher knowing all my emotions. Teachers are supposed to teach you but not only just teach but be there if you need to talk to them about something. I feel like its invading privacy of the student. I think we maybe should because it might actually help the teacher learn more about their students. Some students do not like going to talk to the teacher so maybe if the teacher talks to the student they might feel more better and the teacher will also know about that as well. I think if we got it in schools right now it would probably help.
