Dear Senator,

I believe that rather than having the

Electoral College , we should have elections by popular vote. A popular vote can be a better source of election because it gives the people of the state a better chance to express themselves and have a free, independant country.

The process of the Electoral College consists of a meeting of five hundred-thirty eight selected electors, where they vote for the President and Vice President. This situation can be considered unfair to many people that do not get selected as electors because there opinion is not put into consideration. It is said that over sixty percent of voters would perfer a direct election verses the Electoral College. This statistic goes to show that people do not feel that they are involved in our country. How can you consider this a free and independant nation if we do not all get the privelage to vote?

Sincerely,

PROPER_NAME
