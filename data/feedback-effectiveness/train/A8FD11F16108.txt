This painting is was made a long time ago. Many people found this painting weird because, back then there wasn't a lot of people happy, also poor. So when you see this picture this girl is happy and looks like she has nice cloths on. People took this picutre into inspiration. And brought a lot to the picture.

In my perceptative I like this idea but then I don't. It is pretty nice that we have a software that can be able to do something like this. it is pretty cool to tell people that we need a picture of you or someone and we will see how happy you are, how mad you are, etc. But I'm really not for it that much. There can be more things we can do instead of doing this. But doing this picture was preety cool.

In paragrpah 5 it states that people can tell how your friend is feeling simply by the look on their face. I totally agree with it. If this is your best friend and they are the same to you when you see each other you should smile. But when they don't and still look down then you know there is a problem. Friends are there for each other.

One thing that I argue about this is on paragrpah 6. When you are happy then when a ad pops up then it should be happy. Same way if you were mad then a mad or something down ad will pop up. I don't really agree to this because when people see ads they dont really pay attention to ads. When they see an ad they look at the close button for it and they close it. But if there is an advertisment they of coarse people will have to watch it until the ad is over. I don't like the idea that computers should have computer appresions on what we do.

This article is very good. I like this but of coarse there are some down falls to everything. I like how they did this software on "Making Mona Lisa Smile" becuase this picture inspired other people. But the computer expressions isn't a good idea. They aren't doing this for a good cause. When people have a chance to skip an ad or an advertisment they will.
