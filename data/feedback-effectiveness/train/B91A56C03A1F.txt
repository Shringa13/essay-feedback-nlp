Some people think that the face on Mars is really created by aliens. There is some scientifical evidence to this. The real fact is that the face on Mars is just a natural landform.

When NSSA's Mars Global Survey spacecraft was in space it took pictures. A few days later NASA unveiled a image. There was a natural landform that looked like a human head, shadows gave the rock some eyes, a noes, and mouth. People began thinking that it was an acutal thing created by aliens. Scientists didn't believed this though.

On April 5, 1998, Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time. The team up there snapped picures of the landform again and people were eager to find out the truth about the face. After seeing the picture when it was appeared on a JPL web site people now knew the truth. It is just a landform and not a face created by aliens.

It's obvious now, the face is just a naturtal landform. There were no aliens.
