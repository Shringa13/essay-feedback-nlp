When the author talks about Venus he talks about how it is and what it is like and how it works. Venus is different from Earth but it is the same in some way. It is differnt because of the tempurature and the atmosphere and the surface. The tempurature reaches up to 800 degrees fahrenheit and that is unsurvivable for humans. The surface is bad to it is a hot lava and molten like suface and it can melt most metals. Venuses atmosphere is mainly filled with 97 percent of carbon dioxide. The air pressure is really bad it is strong enough it could crush a submarine like its going down to the deepest part of our oceans. NASA is trying to come up with a way to study Venus with a blimp like vehicle that can float 30 miles up away from Venus and its nasty surface and atmosphere. Even though the tempurature will reach only 170 degrees fahrenhite it is still survivable for humans.
