Studying planets is often hard because of the conditions in space, and also on the planet Venus there are also very harsh conditions that humans cannot survive. Venus has a thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus. Exploring Venus can be a very risky planet for us to expore until we get better technology.

Venus is often reffered to as Earth's twin because it is the closest planet to be like Earth in terms of density and size, and occasionally the closest in distance too. Venus would be hard to expore becuase of the planet's suface reaching up to 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmosphere pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet. Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet of solar system and if we tried to land a rover there the metal would just liquify because of the extreme temperature's. NASA however, still wants to try to study the planet but they would have to hover over Venus because of the extreme conditions on the planet's surface. Even at 30 plus miles in the air in Venus the temperatures can reach up to 170 degrees Fahrenheit. However, peering at Venus from a ship orbiting or hovering safely far above the planet can provide only limited insight on ground conditions because most forms of light cannot penetrate the dense atmosphere. Rendering standard of photography and videography ineffective. The solar power would be plentiful, and radiation would not exceed Earth's level.

More importantly, reasearchers cannot take samples of rock, gas,or anything else, from a distance. Threfore, scientists seeking to conduct a thorough mission to understand Venus would need to get up close and personal despite the risks. Many reasearchers are working on innovations that would allow the machines to last long enough to contribute meaningfully to our knowledge of Venus.
