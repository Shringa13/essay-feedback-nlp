Dear state senator,

We should definitely strive in keeping the electoral college for so many reasons. We need to keep the electoral college because it serves so many purposes in the united states. It hepls us decide who our president and vice presidents will be and it is a big help on our state workers.

And most of the reason that people want to stop it is because they think that some of the nominees arent getting what they deserve. We do understand that they put a lot of work in trying to become president but not everyone can win. And to be fair, after the presidential election is over, our govenor prepares a "Certificate of Ascertainment" listing all of the candiates who ran for president in our state along with the names of their respective electors.

The presidential election is held every four years on the Tuesday after the first Monday in November. You help choose your states electors when you vote for president because when you vote for your candidate you are usually voting for your candidates electors.

Each candidate running for president in your state has his or her own group of electors. The electors are generally chosen by the candidates political party, but state laws vary on how the elecotrs are selected and what their responsibilities are.

The advocates of this position are correct in arguing that the Electoral College method is not democratic in a modern sense...it is the electors who elect the president, not the people. So when you vote for your president your acually voting for the slate of electors.

Having this Electoral College is so much help to our state workers. They dont actually have to do everything now...thanks to the Electoral College.

So please strive to help keep the Electoral College.

sincerely,
