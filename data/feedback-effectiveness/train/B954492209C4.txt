It was a stormy night, the wind shook and almost tipped this dang ship to the bottom of the sea. "Captain we need to go back to shore, if we don't we'll all die!" My captain said nothing, and then without hesetaition he screamed" This is NOTHING, got it men I've expiranced worse so die or be dead." All the men start screaming, in the backround I could hear the cows and people grabing on to them to save there lives." Captain I see something, it looks like a watermelon?" Then a quick swoop and he grabbed the telescope and saw a tree."We're SAVED."

We actully arrived at France. "A man walked up to me and said you here to bring cows?" My freind Don all ready got some cows of the ship, people started gathering around and they were exited because they had hope. I asked the captain if I could make an anouncement. "Why, yes you've been such a good man I let you, but only this time." He had a dread look. I walked up to the podem and said and quote this,"People, we are short of some cowboys for our program and we'd like some voluntiers, if anyone of you are grateful enough please join." No one raised there hand, I could see mothers sushing their child. I gave up and backed down.

My friend Don came up to me and said." It's okay we really don't need any more people, besides we'll have less food for us." He knew I had a sad look so he just walked away. After I woke up I went to the kitchen to get my breakfeast and no one was there, so I yelled out. Anyone home!?" Then I went on the regerstration room I saw hundreds of people waiting to sign up, we didn't even have any more ships to carry that much. I asked Don how did you do this, he just said. "Hope."
