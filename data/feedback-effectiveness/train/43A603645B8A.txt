Summer projects should be student designed because honestly what student wants to do their work over the summer. Student designed projects may include what they did over their break or what they wish they did over break, some students will most likely forget about it anyway because its summer and some people have to work also. i believe it would be more interesting for a student designed projects because it would most likely be, again, what they did over the summer.

students, indeed yes need their education and they need to learn, that is why if a teacher just hands them a project and say here you have to have this complete before you come back after summer break. that will knock the interest level down a lot for students. when its summer break i love to go off and have fun with my friends and family, we always are out doing something weather it be hanging around the house or off on a trip somewhere, other students dont do this and it is honestly really cool, last summer my girlfriend and i went down to nags head with her family, i had the most fun time while we were down there, even though i accidentally left my wallet at her house.

Students learn best when they are on their own and/or out doing something, the teachers already know what to do about a teacher designed project and that i do believe is why some students dont get along with the teacher. Teachers want to help kids and kids that have troubles listening or learning, i'm not saying that teachers dont listen because you have some of them that do, but, unfortunatelyÂ teachers dont interact with students as they should so a student designed project would make it a lot more entertaining and interesting for the teacher because it allows the teacher to sit back and read about who that kid is, what that kid likes, and how that kid acts, it shows a lot of that and it is really helpful for the teacher to actually understand the student that is doing the project and know how his or her lifestyle is, i agree, students should come up with a student designed project over the summer.
