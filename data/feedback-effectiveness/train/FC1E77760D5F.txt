If you're going to make a claim about something you must first have evidence to back-up that claim or it can't be taken as fact, but it doesn't make it untrue or true until there is evidence proving it. Instead of following what you think is true, which is based on opinion because you have no evidence, follow where the evidence leads because you will discover things that you have never knew before.

If someone is arguing that the face was created by aliens they will need evidence to prove that. But NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft, according to paragraph 1 wasn't taking pictures that were as sharp as "Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) that snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos in paragraph 7, revealing a natural landform other than an alien monument," but it sure is possible that those pictures could've been covered up and are designed to look like natural land forms, as the conspiracy theorists are claiming because how could you possibly know what they did to the photos before releasing them to the public? But you will need evidence to prove that. In paragraph 10 the Mars Global Surveyor took another photo revealing a butte or mesa, landforms common around the American-West according to NASA, but again how can you take that for literal truth?
