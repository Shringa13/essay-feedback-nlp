The author suggests that studying Venus is a worthy pusuit despite th dager is presents. There is a lot of danger in this planet, Life can't be found in this planet do to the extreme temperature of the sun which it could go up to 800 degrees Fahrenheit and 90 times more the pressure of the Earth. Why would the author think that studyng venus would be a good idea? According to the text " Astronomers are facinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like."

This show how the author that studying venus is a worthy.

Another reason why the author suggest that studying venus would be a worthy pusuit despite the danger is that Venus was probably covered with oceans and it could be our nerest option for a planetary visit.
