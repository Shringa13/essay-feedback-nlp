To the principal,

It has come to my attention that many students are involved in work such as, sports, academics, and more primarily community service. As a common student of this establishment I think to myself whether it is right or wrong to do community service. In my opinion, community service is like a thank-you to our environment, neighbors, and government, especially in such a hard economic time. Though, as I look at my peers they think community service is something like a "scandal", which influences others, such as myself to not go on with these deeds. Why is the world like this? I know it is simply not because community service is bad. I know for sure that is wrong, or is it because people today are too lazy? Or simply scared of criticism? Yet, we as people must give back to our community, not act as if it were to be a burden. Yes, I know times like these are dreadfully hard, with taxes, jobs, and money. Though, I can't help but wonder. What if everyday we woke up with a good feeling, a feeling of empathy for others, our lives, and especially our own community within this fine country? We as the children or America must stand up, ignore criticism and judgement and just do the right thing. As I strongly write this letter, I must ask these questions. Do you think it is necessary to do community service? Do you think it is needed to give back to our communities and just say thank-you? Do you think it is the right thing to do, to love and be proud of our freedom?

This is what I think of community service, and outstanding way of showing our gratitude to our communities. Please think about this and ask yourself this. Do you give back to your community? And if so, please strongly consider to make it a rule for us students to do community service.

Sincerely,
