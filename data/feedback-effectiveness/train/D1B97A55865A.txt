Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I think students should have the opportunity to do community service, but they shouldn't have to do it.

One reason I think community service shouldn't be required is because some students may play sports or be in a club or group and not have any time between school and their extracurricular activity to work in the community.

Also if you make community service required many students may spend so much time on their community service they may lose the passion for the sport they enjoy so much.

Also the students that already do community service may do it for fun or they enjoy helping others, but they may not enjoy it if they are forced to do it.

Personally i don't enjoy community service but I still do it by helping the elderly by fixing up their porches or building a ramp for them if they are confined to a wheelchair.

Although I enjoy it I don't want to be made to do it.

I also think many people that do community service enjoy being with people and being social or environmentally friendly.

I know I am more of a social person so I like working for people that I can talk to about things they like to do and stuff I do.

also if you make people perform community service many students grades may go down because they are focusing on their community service time than their grades.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
