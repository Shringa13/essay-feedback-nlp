One method of chosing a President is having an electoral college here in the U.S.A.Â  That means, the people vote for a group of electors. Not the candidate running for President. In that group they count in the votes and elect witch candidate would win.

There are many people that do no agree with this method. One should be able to put in there vote straight to who wins at an election not send it off to a group of people that one does not know. It's part of the list of rights the people should have. Any one can be a elector. In the past, an elector has change there candiate. so instead of who a person's vote going to who they voted for... it would go to the other candidate. Not everything hat should be right in this world is.

The "winner-takes-all" system is when all electors are awarded to the winning presidential candidate. This helps when it comes down to what is fair and what isn't. When Obama got 61.7 percent and Romney only had 51.3 most electoral votes were on the "winner-takes-all" basis.

Yes, it's true. Not all state has the same number of electoral votes. But that is just because not every state has the same population as one and other. If every state got the same amount of electoral votes, them it wouldn't be fair. North Carolina doesn't have the same populations as Texas. it wouldn't make sence to give them both just 3 or both 38.

People like to do things on there own and like to feel like the contrubuted to socity. One should vote for themselfs on who should run our country. An electoal college is not needed anymore.
