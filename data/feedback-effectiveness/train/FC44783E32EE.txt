I personally think that for once in a lifetime America and when I say America I mean the people of our nation should be able to elect presidents of the United States by popular votes. I know some of you is questioning yourselves why would i say something like that and that reason is because I know there's people arguing here in our society about their beliefs in why one person should become president and another arguing why one should become president. In the passage it reads under the 23rd ammendment of the constitution the district of Columbia is allocated 3 electors and treated like a state for purposes of the Electoral Ccllege. But if you ask me me I'll be saying and asking you or in other words the congress why do you guys have to go through all of this just to get to a president electionÂ  and have a president of the United States .It's just some things the world have gone though are totally dramatic and this is the very first thing a person's going to say "the world's a very corrupt place nowadays"but in my eyes i say that the world can become a better place if the people cooperate togather and stop trying to always slice eachother's throats about a stupid reasoning over a dumb presidential election that the house of representatives have put togather and now they want to act as if they had no par-take in the action going on. So I think the people on our own should be able to vote fo rour own president and not have congress put in there who they think is fit for the position of being president. I state this because the one who always look peaches and cream aint always sugar they say things in the campaigns to get us americans on either sides but when we vote for that one who said he going to stop this and that and then when he get in the chair of being president,they don't do nothing at all. So i say let America vote for it's own presidency and not the people.
