Hello to begin off with im going to say a few opions of my own in which way to agrue in favor of keeping the Electoral College or changing to election by popular vote. I would have to go with electral college because better who would want a rich person voting last that would not be fair. So now im going to talk about few things why i picked this response.

To Start off with is why did i pick this, i pick this because the electoral college is a moving process full of educated students looking to make whats best out of what ever they have. ''the founding fathers established it in the constitution'' that students over 18 can vote. but the cons of this is their still young a their still growing up I get that. The electoral college process consists many of the selection of the electors like meeting of the electors where they vote for president and vice president also counting of the electoral votes by congress.

Getting to a close to end now so let me keep giving you infor mation why i pick electoral college instead of popular vote, popular vote in my opionon is in my way letting the poor still be poor. this is why i pick electorcal vote.
