Dear state senator,

I think we should end the Electoral college because it is not fair to each american. It's not fair because voters can't control who they pick, and the person they vote for end up losing the presidential election. Even though our founding fathers established this act it doesn't mean it benefits our country.

The electors are chosen by the candidate's democratic or republican's party. Some states has a "winner-take-all" process. When that process is over and the candidate win the presidential vote in that state, it then shows which electors will represent your state. Although this would seem like a good way to vote I disagree. It is unfair to everyone.

It would be a lot easier for every citizen to just make their own personal vote.  For an example, back in 2000 Al Gore had way more popular voters than George W. Bush who had a higher number of voters due to the Electoral College process. I think every state should reconsider picking the electors because they always seem to defy us. Losing the Electoral College can also avoid any mishap in the future. What if there was a state that had equal number of votes? what would happen then?

It has been stated that over 60 percent of citizens would rather vote towards their candidate they select, rather than going through the process. congress should consider the thoughts and opinions that us voters have. If they wish to not do so the candidate with the popular votes could potentially lose presidency.

In conclusion to the eyes of the government it may seem like a proper way to vote, but to us it's unfair. You should abolish the Electoral College for good so we can elect the right candidate who deserves presidency. In order to get rid of this process we should take a single vote from every citizens.
