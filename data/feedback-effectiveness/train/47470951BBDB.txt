Do you remember a time you hated cleaning you house?

Well if people hate doing that imagine them doing community service and how that don't have air conditioning like a house do its outside in the hot sunny day and just have water to drink sweet coming down your face. some people complain of what they have and what they don't have, how nasty the food is and not, how one person got something better then they do, how hard it is to keep on cleaning everyday of their life. But, the best thing to have is a beautiful place to live but we wont have that if we don't keep our self together and keep our environment clean because if we don't then we would be living in a nasty ugly place then a nice and beautiful one like North Carolina how sweet and beautiful the air is. But some people are to selfish to give up a little bet of their time to help and keep our community safe and clean for each another i mean how hard is it. Why would they rather live in a nasty dirty place? we should all in school accepted to work together and do community service and change mother earth and livings around us. So i think we should do community service don't you?
