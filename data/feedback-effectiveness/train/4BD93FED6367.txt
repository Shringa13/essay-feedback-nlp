A Face on Mars, or just a common mesa? Many skeptics belive that the mesa on Mars, located at 41 degrees north martian latitude, is proof of ancient alien civilazation. In 1976, when NASA's Viking 1 crossed over a landform that showed "shadowy likeness" of a human face. When NASA revealed the picture to the public, thinking it would be a good way to draw attention to Mars, caused an uproar.

A few years later, Micheal Malin and his team took a picture 10x sharper than that of the Viking 1 spacecraft. When the photo first appeared online, it showed nothing but a common mesa that can be found in the American west. Again skepics were not satisfied, the picture was taken on a cloudy day over Mars. So they began to ask questions like; What if the alein markings were hidden by haze?

So again, on a perfectly clear day, another photo was taken April 8th, 2001. They used the camera's "absolute maximum resolution." Yet again, showing nothing but a common landform. Well what if NASA is hiding evidence of ancient alein life on Mars? Why would NASA hide groundbreaking news like this? "Defenders of the NASA budget wish there was anceint civilazation on Mars."

So why would NASA hide news like this, that would help advance space exploration? What else could it be, all evidence points to nothing except a common mesa.
