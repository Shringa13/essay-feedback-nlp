Scientist are interested in exploring Venus but they find it very hard to explore it. Venus has high temperature that make it harder for them to be able to get a closer look at it which makes it a challenge for scientists for to even get a closer look at it. If Venus is Earth's sister planet why is it so inhospitable for us to live in it.

Why are scientist wasting their time trying to explore it and how would we know what is actually in Venus if we haven't yet explored it. I think it may be a bit to dangerous for any of us to actually be able to explore it without the right equipment and the right person to send there without knowing for sureif they would be getting hurt or not. I think it is to much of a risk to send someone up there and risk their lifes all just to be sure if Venus is safe or not.

In paragraph 4 it states that "Long ago,Venus was probably covered lagely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life,just like in Earth"scientist could just want us to have a better future for our future kids and families along the way. In this pargraph it is saying that Venus could be another resource for us to use as an Evacuation if Earth is no longer safe for us we have a second choice.

We may never know if we don't explore it but I still think it is a bit to much of a risk for us to take because we never know something could go terrible wrong and we all end up no longer exsisting.

Earth has many similarities and many differences scientist want to be able to study Venus to be able to come up with new vehices another project is looking back at an old technology called mechanical computers. These devises make calculations by using gears and levers and don't require electronics at all. in article 8 it says tha we shouldn't be scared of what may happened all that matter s is what's right for the people.
