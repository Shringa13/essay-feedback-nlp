Dear Senator,

I think that we should change over to election by popular vote. I thinks that because in the Electoral College the voters dont vote on the president, but instead they vote on the electors who then vote for the president. "It's official: the electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational. "The advocates of this position are correct in arguing that the Electoral College method is not democratic in a modern sense....it is the electors who elect the president, not the people. There are five reasons for getting rid of the Electoral College despite its lack of democratic pedigree; all are preactical, not liberal or conservative reasons. Some people disagree though they think that we should stick with the electoral college. They think its a good way to do the voting because they get to choose the electors who will choose our president. Inconclusion, I think that we should do election by popular vote because then the voters get to choose the president.

Sincerly,

Britney
