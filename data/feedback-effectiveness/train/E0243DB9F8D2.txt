Do you believe in aliens? If so do you believe them living in outer space or perhaps on a different planet? Imagine if you worked for NASA and you found pictures about an "Unmasking face on Mars". What would you do or even think about if you had seen faces on the surface of Mars?

I work for NASA and I have have found pictures about a face on Mars and through my perpectives I believe that its an alien on the surface on Mars. The reason why I believe this is an alien because the face is an absolute landform of an alien. These photos were taken 1976, 1998 and 2001. In 2001 the face evolted more like a face of what humans it was of humans but I've been doing research that these faces are from aliens.

Although it does look like a human face theres no body connected to it unless the body is stuck underneath the surface of the planet, but through my research I insist it's an alien. I do not have proof it is one but theres no proof of it being a human either. When the Mars Orbiter Camera went around Mars the face still had no evidence if it was either a human face or an alien artifact.

In my case I still prove this to be an alien. We've done plenty of research and nothing has been found is it is a human face or an alien. My question is if that it was a human why wouldn't have we known it was a human if it died. Where'd the rest of their body go? Perhaps it was trapped under the surface but in no question I still believe this is an artifact of an alien.
