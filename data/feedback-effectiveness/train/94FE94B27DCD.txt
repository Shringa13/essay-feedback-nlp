Dear, TEACHER_NAME

I believe our school should have community service.

Why ?

Because, students should not litter on school property and make our school look trashy.

School is a place to learn not to litter and destroy the schools .

In the following paragraphs, I will persuade you to require school community service in our school.

In SCHOOL_NAME, the population of litter is huge.

Students here think after using an object and its time to dispose it, it belongs on the ground.

All students at SCHOOL_NAME

should take part and help.

Making our school look better will be a big helping hand.

By that I want to totally help to clean up our school !

I would first make a survey. Post it out in each hallway in the school.

Then I would have every student to sign yes if they think its a good idea to have community service or no.

With the following students that has pick yes I will call a meeting.

Next I would ask them what days are good to stay after school and clean or can they come everyday.

The students that will not take part of this act I would make another community service.

Our school looks horrible especially the break areas.

Also the court yard of the school pavement need to be refill with concrete.

The school walls, classrooms, and hallways need to be repainted.

The graffiti on the hallways wall and outside the school building walls need to be painted over.

I strongly believe us students can do it.

With this all said and done, Principle TEACHER_NAME I have may reasons why you should require school community service. First I believe our school should have community service because it looks trashy not classy.

Second because students think trash belongs on the ground. My third reason is because inside the school building needs repainting.

Most all ,all students should take part in this act to make our school look like a school not a public park !
