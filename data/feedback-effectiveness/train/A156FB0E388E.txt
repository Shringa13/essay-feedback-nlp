The author suggest the reader to study Venus isnt directly in the text but he/she gives you the idea that you should look into it. Throughout the article the author talks about Venus and others planets in out solar system. but he mainly talks about Venus and Mars. The author tells us that Venus isn't actaully a Evening star, it just has that name because it is closer to the sun. Venus is also referred to as Earth's "twin" because it is the closest planet to us in density and size and sometimes distance. In the text it says "Venus can be right around the corner in space'. Even though Venus is right around the corner we have still yet to land an actually spaceship on it. There hasn't been any space craft the a has been successfully on Venus for more than a few hours.. Although in paragraph 6 it says ''many researchers are working on innovations that would allow our machines to long enough to contribute meaning to our knowledge of Venus''. This is tell us that there is still stuff to learn about mars and this story isnt complete.
