In the article the author trlls how a new technolgy called the Facisl Action Coding System that identify human emotions. The software is used to "calculate emotions". They can caculate six basic emotions "happiness, suprise. anger,disgust,fear, and sadness". It can tell all of thoes things by your face movements and how you talk. Anyonw can tell if you are sad and dont want to be bothered so it shows emotion but if you "put on a happy face" it could accully make you very happy.

The tecnology could help the student becuase it tells them whenthey are looking bored or sleepy. Dr. Huang is predicing that the tecnology could have a "effective human instructor" the tecnogly is very smart it could also make computer animated faces more expressive for video games or video surgery. In the passage they gave an example of a real face painted of "Mona Lisa" becuase in the picture she has a stright face and she shows "no emotion". But it is also made to put a smile on your face.

The computer model of the face technology has to have a 3D face model and has to have "all 44 muscles in the model must move like human muscles". Humans "preform the same impressive calcualtion everday". everybody had diferent facal expressions.

In conclusion the use of technology to read the emotional expressions of the students in the classroom is valialbe becuase they all need to know how there emotions are and how they are looking in a classroom or jsut on the daily basic. And they can also see what emotional are meaning at that tiem when they didnt. It aslo tells if someone has a real smile and a fake one.
