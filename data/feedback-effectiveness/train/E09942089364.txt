What would I say if I were a scientist at NASA discussing the Face with someone who thinks it was created by aliens, when I don't? I would first off say they're are no such things as aliens. There is no evidence that aliens are real. The only evidence we have are pictures that people send in of "UFOs" or "aliens" being spotted. Seriously those pictures could be easily edited with the power of the internet.

The Face is just a natural landform! The Face, like many other landforms, looks (hince the name) like a face! Have you ever past by a hill, rock, or any other landform that kind of looks like a human or any other human part? If you have than you know what I'm talking about. Sometimes you start thinking "why does it look ike that?" or "what if someone's body is buried there?".

Although the Face looks like a face, it may have not been built by aliens. Like NASA said when they unveiled the image for everyone to see, it's just a "huge rock formation... which resembles a human head... formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth.". The Face was just formed by shadows and your eyes playing a little trick on you.

We don't have enough evidence to prove that aliens created this, so it's much better if we stick to my idea. It's all the work of your eyes, shadows, and the form of the rock. If only we could go to Mars and figure out the truth.
