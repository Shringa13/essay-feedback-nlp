i believe that smart cars, or driverless cars, are a thing of the future. only the future.

smart cars seem like a good idea to some, mostly the people that can not drive, due to handicap.

the cars wouldnt be driving themselves, they would only do simple tasks. such as, steer, accelerate, and brake. humans can do all of that, and more, just fine. the cars "heads up display" can work miracles. yet, if the driver isnt paying any attention to them, then the whole thought goes down the drain.

if one of these "smart cars" where to get in a road accedent, would it be the manufacturers or the drivers fault. i beileve that it would be the manufacterers fault. if the car has a faulty sytem. then there may be more danger in these cars, than any good. Also, google had announced its first smart car accident, March 1st, 2016. thankfully no one was hurt, but it just shows these cars are not perfect, by any means.
