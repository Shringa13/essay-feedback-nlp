So alot of people think that "The Face on Mars" is an alien type of structure. People say this kind of things becuase they have no proof that it's a formation just like earth have formations.

Im here to tell you people that thats a type of formation that happens. Like Garvin said its a type of landform that happens in the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. Im gonna tell you why i agree. Us as a NASA team we work hard to solve what it was such as reasearch, scientists working, and our team that snapped the picture. All of us tried to figure out what it was yes we might of thought that it was some type of alien structure but like i said working hard got us where we needed to be. After what we needed to figure out we realized that it wasn't some alien structure using the "Rule of Thumb" we saw the picture 3 times bigger. After we saw that image we atoumatically realized that it was a simple formation same as what happens to earth. Example like what happen to Colorado. It use to have a river but after years the water started to evaperate and it started forming big giant rocks. Thats why i don't thing that its some kind of alien structure.
