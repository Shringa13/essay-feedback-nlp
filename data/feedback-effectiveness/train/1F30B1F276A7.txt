Dear TEACHER_NAME i think that students should perform community service it would be great for our community and should be required or mandatory for the school for the greatness that it would bring to our community for instance you could teach a mean and disrespectful kid who has no respect for his teachers to gain respect on the effect they have on the community should he do community service, you could teach 6the graders the meaning of life just by picking up trash after all a tutor elementary school has there kids doing work keeping there community clean why shouldn't the same go for ours, if an adult sees a 6the grader picking up trash you would think he will say why shouldn't i pick up trash kids picking up trash are good examples to the community, and this might clean up our streets more that you think about it, this is also so good way to support many child obesity campaigns such as Mitchell obama this would more than likely get media attention , keeping kids active and of the streets from doing drugs and crimes, or away from them these here are all the reasons i think community service would have a drastic affect on our community signed STUDENT_NAME
