The face on Mars is just a landform. There is no such thing as aliens. Alson there is no life of any type that can live on Mars. "Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing . . . a natural landform."

The picture shows us a part of Mars where the face is just form in that weird way. Makin people think there was aliens on Mars. Mars is not a liveable place. There is no air to breathe, and it is to hot. You wouldn't make it alive in Mars, because you would lose your breath and burn up.

All the picture is show us is that a natural landform has formed on Mars. It is a great picture off landform you might never see again, but it has nothing to do with aliens on Mars. If aliens were real, one of

NASA'S scientists would have found them in outer space by now. The face is just a great form of natural landform.
