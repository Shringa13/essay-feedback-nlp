"Unmasking the Face on Mars" is a hard subject for some people. Not everybody thinks its a natural landform but many scientist do! The "face" on Mars could be many things but scientist have evidence that it is a natural landform. In the story it says that the natural artifact is like some landforms in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. It also says that few scientist believe the Face was an alien artifact so if it's not that and that have other evidence it has to be a natual artifact.

The Face is very similar to natural artifacts here on Earth. In the story it talks about a place in idaho that is very similar to the Face. It also says it looks very much like a lava dome. Scientist say a place in Idaho that is called Middle Butte looks very similar to the Face. The pictures the very nice camera took of the Face is proof that they do look alike and that it is just a natural artifact.

Not very many scientist believe that the Face is an alien artifact and they back that up with the fact that it doesn't have the features of it. It might look very much like a humans face but they do not believe that. There scientist and they have evidence that it is not human like its just a natural artifact.

Some people might believe that it is a human face and that the face does look like it but no it is a natural artifact. It is a natural artifact because scientist believe that and they have facts to back up there reasoning, for example in the story it talks about how the "Face on Mars" was a huge hit to scare people and things like that and then scientist come out and say they have conspiracy theories that the face is not evidence that there is life on Mars.

All in all, scientist have many theories and evidence that the Face is a natural artifact. The Face might actually look like a person but there isn't facts yet that show there is life on Mars.
