On my Opinion i think is a good way to the student that they can take classes on online or on video chat is a good way to do it, because some students sometimes some of then they live so far of the school so they dont have other way to educate they self and i think is a good communication to learn.

Is a good benefit because is a easy way to do it, easy and fast and is good too because sometimes some days is snowing and when is snowing all school are closed. And they close the school because the students can not trasportate to the like that because the streets are freeze and really complicate to transport to the school.

If i have to take classes on online or video chat i will because more easy for me and is not difficult to learn on online or video chat. And because i can have more free time i can do more things and i can have a job.

And think too for some student is not good because they dont have the opportunity to have a computer t do they classes online or they dont have internet is difficult for them. Is a good option online classes but not for all students some of them are benefit and some of them dot.

Only classes are a good reason to use because is a good way to cominitate in a long distance, but Free online schools, have to be free all schools online for all students they dont have to pay nothing.

The time if they take online classes they they go not miss nothing because they can star when they want.

On my oponion is a goog way to do it.
