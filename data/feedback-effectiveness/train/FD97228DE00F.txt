Dear Principal,

The two policies are both important to the future of this school. Although that might be, policy two is much better for many reasons. policy two will allow the children in school to be able to contact there parents at any time in case of an emergency. Additionally this will insure that the students will always be in touch with family or friends during school hours so that they know they can get a hold of them at any time during the school day. When a parents need to let there children know something they can always let them know. This will be better because that will enforce to the children that they will know of any emergencies or change of plans at home. On the other hand, cell phones not allowed in class is good. This does make sure the students do not text or call during class. They need to be learning and paying attention so they will be smart and go to college and have a great successful life. This will be good for the children to be able to be in contact with individuals out side of the school area and yet still be learning and getting a higher education. Therefore, policy two will be more efficient to the children and to this school.

From, Your Student
