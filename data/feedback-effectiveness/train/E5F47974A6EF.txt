NASA received a photo from Viking 1, in 1976, and it appeared to be a face. In 1998, a higher resolution picture came in and in 2001 an even higher resolution picture came in. NASA scientist thought aliens created this. But they didn't it was just a Martian mesa. A few days after they figured out it was a Martian mesa, NASA unveiled the image for all to see. The caption on it noted a "huge rock formation... which resembles a human head... formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes,nose,and mouth." Authors reasoned it would be a good way to engage the public and attract attention to Mars. And it certainly did! The

"Face on Mars" has since become a pop icon. It starred in a Hollywood film, appears in books, magazines, radio talkshows- even haunted grocery store checkout lines for 25 years! The picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa. The "Face on Mars" wasn't an actually face. It was only a Martian mesa. If scientist actually proved aliens are real I'm sure they won't tell the public.
