I thank policy one is better, because kids will bring cell phones to school no mater what. They will hide them from the teachers .Teachers can't go threw the students stuff any way . Just make the kids put them in there locker during class.

If you do a lot of the students will dich school any way, to be on there phones. You will just make all the kids mad.

Some kids will ask there parents to transfer school. If you chose policy one you will make the student happy. The happier the students the happier you should be. It might help the kids, like make new friends. To do better at school not thanking about there phone, give them something to look forward to school.

Help the students have fun at school. They may have fun at school. Help them help you.

You can make school fun with policy one. We use them to pass time on the bus.

It can really help. To listen to muics on the bus, play games.
