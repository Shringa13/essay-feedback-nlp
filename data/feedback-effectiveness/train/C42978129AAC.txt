Dear Principal,

I think you should use policy 1 for several reasons. If someone needs a ride after school and there are no cell phones, there will be no way to communicate with your parents or get any help. Cell phones should be turned off in class though. I see many people with their phones under their desks and that is not okay. That is a distraction from getting your learning that your teacher works hard on showing you. Though cell phone use is inappropriate in class, it should be okay to use them during lunch. Lunch is your free time, you should be able to do any thing you want.

Some adults get really worked up over cell phones. They aren't a bad thing. They are amazingly useful and they are only bad when they are used in class. Cell phones are great for communicating. You can talk to someone anywhere at anytime for free. If you need help or are in a car accident, you can just use your cell phone and they will help you.

If you use policy 1 as your guide line, I expect you to not change any single word to the policy. You will expect us to not use them in class or anywhere at school other than at lunch or other free times. Thank you for reading this message and I hope you agree with me.

Sincerely, STUDENT_NAME
