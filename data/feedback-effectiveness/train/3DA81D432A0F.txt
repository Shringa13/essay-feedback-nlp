So all in all exploring venus is a goodish idea if we can figure out how to actualy , one make it there and two figure out how to sistain a perminant bace.

there is plenty of good evidence in this artical about space exploration and the such and why i think Venus is an exoplanet (a planet that culd or has sistain life)
