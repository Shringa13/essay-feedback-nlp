There are several ways the author suggests studying venus is a worthy pursuit desite dangers along the way. Some examples of these are, how close Venus is from the sun and how it is very similar to Earth. Also Venus may have had forms of life on it. The author gives examples for each one of these claims and how they would give a positive effect. These are just a few reasons we should explore Venus and figure out more about it.

The first reason to learn more about Venus is how close it is from the sun. One example for this is when the text states,"Venus is the second planet from our sun." Which means that it is not very far away from earth. Another reason to study Venus is how similar it is to earth. An example for this is when the text states,"Venus is the closest planet to the Earth in terms of density and size." A final reason is that Venus may of had forms of life on it. Evidence for this statement is shown when the text states,"Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth." This statement shows how Venus could have been very, very similar to earth.

In conclusion the reasons for exploring Venus include how close it is to the sun, how similar it is to Earth, and how it could have supported life forms long ago. Yes, it is very dangerest because of high temperature and pressure. But if we come up with a way to lower the temperature and pressure it will be surely worth the work put in. These reason are way we should try to visit Venus in the future.
