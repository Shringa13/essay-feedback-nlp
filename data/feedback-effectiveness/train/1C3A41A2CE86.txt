Well I think that the electoral college should stay because, its much easier then just picking a person to run the united states. The first reason is because, all you need to get is 270 votes just to win the whole thing. Also the winner take all deal is when the person with the most vote would take the others votes beacsue that person dont have all of the votes, so the person with the most votes would take all of the votes. This is from passage Dose the electoral college work? And the electoral college was founed by the founding fathers, so we know that this thing is really good to use.

The things that are wrong with use the electoral college is that is the person gets their votes for thir state the might just win because, the more the people that live there more of the votes that they might get. Pluse that shoulldnt be right beacsue that person knows everyone that lives in the town and they might not know that the other person is way much better then the person that  they knew for many years. Also most people thing the electoral college is un fair beacsue it doesnt really give you the right things and the peple might be force to chose the wrong person beaucsue they knew that person for many years but the dont nothing about the other person.
