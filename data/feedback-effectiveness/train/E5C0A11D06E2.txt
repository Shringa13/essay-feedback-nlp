Dear Mr. Senator,

The citizens of your state are crying injustice, but nothing is being done to serve them. The Electoral College goes against the Bill of Rights opening words of "We the People". The current system of electing the President is more complex and less beneficial than choosing our leader through popular vote. The popular vote actually listens to the people of the United States' opinion and how they want this country run. The Electoral College has many faults such as in the case of electoral overuling popular vote, possible corruption of state senators (no accusation presented), and could lead to the rare event of a tie.

Such as in the election of 2000, Al Gore should have won the race. The people poke through the popular vote to choose him, but the Electoral College thought otherwise. As stated in the article, that usually state senators choose the representatives of the state in the Electoral College, if bribery and corruption affect our nations such as those in the Miuddle East, the presidential race can and will be rigged in one party's favor. Due to Mane and Nebraska policy of "proportional representation" could lead to a tie.

As you can see, the Electoral College has many faults and is outdated due to the rapid population increase of our nation and reasons stated above. Some may argue there will be inaccuracies with popular vote whereas we already use the popular vote today as a way of forecasting the oucome and seeing the people's real choice.

Thank you for your time Mr. Senator.

Sincerely,

PROPER_NAME
