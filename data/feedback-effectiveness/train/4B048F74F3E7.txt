You should join the Seagoing Cowboy and UNRRA program because you get to see many unique places. Another reason is you get to help people by getting them food and helping them stay alive. Another reason is you get to help hungry soldiers thatare helping our country. In the passage Luke wanted to join the program not just to help people but to see all the amazing places in the story Luke said his favorite place was Greece. You could also see some amazing animals along the way.

Luke liked Greece and the other places so much is in Greece he liked Acropolis. He liked the other places but Greece was his favorite. He also went on nine trips! The most of any Seagoing Cowboys. He also had to clean the stalls of the lower levels of the ship sometimes. One day he had to stop working for a couple of days because of cracked ribs because of flying overboard. The best part of being a Seagoing Cowboy is having fun. The cowboys played baseball,volleyball,and table-tennis and alot of other things too but Luke really loved being a Seagoing Cowboy.
