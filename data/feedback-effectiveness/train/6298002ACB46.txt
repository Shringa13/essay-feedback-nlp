Some people think there is life on other planets and some don't, but in 1976 many people thought NASA had found life on Mars. In 1976 Viking 1 took a photo of mars which looked like a face on the planet's suface. Many believed that this was a sign of life on Mars.

Many of the NASA scientists didn't believe that the face was alien related, but it became a priority for NASA. Soon the Mars Global Surveyor was sent to take more pictures of the face to better find out what it was.

In 1998 the Mars Global Surveyor reached the red planet and took the pictures NASA needed. The pictures it took were more detailed then the ones in 1976. At home, thousands of people waited for the image that the Mar Gobal Surveyor took to reach to web.

The reveal was a natural landform and not alien artifact after all. Still some people didn't belive that

NASA was hiding something. Even though NASA and it's supporters said they would have wanted it to be alien.

Some people still believe NASA is and was hiding something, but we may never know.
