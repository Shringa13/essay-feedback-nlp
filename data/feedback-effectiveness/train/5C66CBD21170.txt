Dear state senator,

I think that Electoral College is a great and fast way to gather up votes to pick on our new president but i think that it has some big issues and the neagtives overcome the positives. One of the great things Electoral College brings that it is widely regarded as anarchronism with means that the votes wont be "overruled" it would acutally be the maguraty of the people voting on the president. If not it would be the elctors who elect the president, not the people. Also the party the people select is highly trusted and rarely betrayed. There have been a lot of cases in the past that go against Electoral College. One of the things that i am against the electoral college is that the voters dont actually vote on the presidental runner up they are actually voting on the state electors that who in turn elect the president. Also most worrying is in the case of a tie in the electrical vote. In that special case the elctection would actually have to go to the House of Representatives which means that state delegations vote on the president and The Senate would choose the vice-president. Basically the Electoral College is unfair to voters cause of the winner takes it all system in each state, candidates dont spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning so they only focus on the tight "swing" states. Its official in my opinion that the Electoral CollegeÂ  is unfair , outdated , lack of democratic pedigree and irrational. It has lack of reasons in favor. I think we should just get over with this and go old school and get done with all this confusing matter and change to election to popular votes it took more of time but it was more accurate and caused less problems. Amazingly Bob Dole was right: Abolish the Electoral College!
