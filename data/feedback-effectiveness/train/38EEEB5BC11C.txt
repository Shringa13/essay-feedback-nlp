Dear , Principle

You are deciding whether to make students perform community service or not. In my opinion i think that students should do community service for many reasons. One reason is that the community is being littered too much and we need people to clean that up. I understand why people may not want to do community service, because they have there own life to take care not pick up after other humans. Well to fix that problem, the service should be done in the morning where students have nothing to do, and in the weekends when they have no school. I also think that while the students are doing the service they should have water breaks and other things to keep them not tired. The students could the service one weekend and another group does the service another weekend, so the students wont get worn out. Another good reason why the students should do community service is because some children don't get enough education at school, so some students can be chosen to tutor those children in need of help. The students schedule should not be that hard , it should be once a week for two months. The other days that are left in the week can be done by another student. Each student is basically helping out , students help a lot by just tutoring a child for at least half an hour. Our community can be much better if the students help out. Principle all i am saying is that community service is good for the community , but i am also saying that if the students do get community service, not to push them too hard.

Sincerely, Student
