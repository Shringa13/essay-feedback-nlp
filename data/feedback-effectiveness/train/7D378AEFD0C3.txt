Imagine you're on a cattle boat about to dock. You are helping by giving the animals away to poor people. Well Luke Bomberger did just that. Luke Bomberger crossed the Atlantic Ocean 16 time and the Pacific Ocean twice to go help peole that were stuggling. You should become a Seagoing Cowboy because you would help people in need, it's a once in a lifetime expirience, and it is fun.

In my opinion, being a Seagoing Cowboy is fun. Other might think it isn't fun at all. However, in the text it states that the cowboys play basketball and volleyball. The text aslo states that they would have table tennis tournaments, boxing, fencing, reading, and they would play games. These details prove that maybe you'll have fun being a Seagoing Cowboy.

I believe that it is an once in a life time expirence. Others might look the other way and think the opposite. However, Luke said that it was a once in a lifetime expirience. Also, in the text it said that Luke got to see the Panama Canal. These details prove that maybe you'll get to see a lot more if you become a Seagoing Cowboy.
