The Electoral College does infact work for most states in USA minus Nebraska and maine. The santor should keep the Electoral College to keep the presidents and vice presidents intact. Without it we the people wont focus at the process of the Electoral College and will become history of dissapointment.

The Electoral College consists more then 538 electors wich keeps this place together, without them what else would they do to help the country? More then 270 electoral vote helps people pick wich president would be best for this country. If we didn't have the Electoral College we would likely have bad presidents that would use they're power to have "fun" with this country for they're enjoyment.

So some people may hate the process, but its because of winner-takes-all system. Some people will see a campaign ad and think that person should or should not win the election, and have a good argument about that person, but at the same time they trust that person.

sometimes the votes that voters vote for may not or may not go to the person that voted for, but that isnt a big issue bigeest out of all the people in the USA the vote that they did made a person feel happy about themselves because it shows that some amount of people care.
