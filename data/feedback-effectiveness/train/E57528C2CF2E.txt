I personally believe that, the landform in the moon is actually a landform not a "face". I say that because due to some of the information from the argument in this passage.

The landform in the moon is not a face because, scientist have proven actual facts on this topic. "Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the first image appeared on a JPL website, revealing a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all." In addition, i also believe that there is no way face could just randomly appear inside of the moon monument because, I think there are no sure thing as aliens. And i think that no humans were even exsistent by the time that monument happened. "And so on April 5, 1998, when Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time, Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) team snapped a puicture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos." Also, scientist figured it was just another Martian mesa, common enough around Cydonia, only this one had unusual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh.

In conclusion, i still strongley feel as if the moon dosent have a face i just feel like it was all a mistake or an imagination.
