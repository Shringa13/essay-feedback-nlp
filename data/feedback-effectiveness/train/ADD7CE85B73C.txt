Students should be able to have cell phones at school because what harm is it doing to the child if they text during a passing period or during lunch? Its not hurting anybody as long as the phone is turned off and doesn't cause a distraction during class time then why would it be a problem?

I know that some teenagers will still try to text during class but the number of people who do will go down. The school should treat students and teachers fairly. If there trying to be fair then the teachers shouldn't be aloud to use there cell phones during class either. Cell phones aren't even that bad in the first place. Yes, most of Americans use them to much, and they are a huge distraction most of the time but they still haven't done any harm to the American society. Actually cell phones have actually brought a lot of people closer together. They also serve the purpose to help people out.

I understand there's not that great of a purpose to having a cell phone at school, but it would make the student body a whole lot happier than it is today. Just the short time we have during class would just be so much better for everybody in the entire school. I still don't even understand why we aren't aloud to use them during class. Why do the teachers care, there getting paid? If a student doesn't want to listen then they shouldn't be forced too. Kids go to school to get a education i understand it shouldn't be interrupted by cell phones. but kids need to have a good time well learning. School is a place for education but come on at least let kids have some socialization.

Letting kids use cell phones during class would be a huge deal to everybody at SCHOOL_NAME it will make the three years we have at this school go by as fast as possiable.
