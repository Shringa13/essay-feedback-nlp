The face on mars have to be a alien because back in time they did not have spaceships. If they did have spaceships back in the past we would of already discover it by now. It's probably a alien because it was buried in the ground for so may years that face is actually popping out. They should unburied it to see if it's human or not. If it is they have alot of research to do if not they still have alot have research to do. They should try to see if a body goes with that head. It could be a decovery of a new world. At the end of the article they said " that's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars." They can also look up any information about mars having a volcanoe. That no one knows about. but if we just know found this it is more likey to be a alien. Because we been going to mars for a long time and it's weird that they just know recover that face. What happen if it's not a alien or human what if its just a rock that turned into a face.
