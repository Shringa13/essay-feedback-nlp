Dear Principal,

I think our school should keep performing community an service, because it's a fun and good task, and most kids at different schools don't get the opportunity to experience community and service day.

It's also a good source on ourselves, so that could mean a good thing on our images when we get older, or even when we go to college. I also think that for the students who don't want to continue community and service can have consequences here back at school or they either keep going with the other students.

Helping with the community is a great learning experiences for us middle school students, since we never got to do it in elementary besides help wash the dishes in the cafeteria in elementary school, so it's fun here.

My opinon for those who think community and service takes too much time away from what they need or want to do should stop woring about it becasue it may be boring sometimes or fun, but they should just know that we are doing this for a good cause by helping the community with feeding and clothing the homeless, helping out sick and needy kids that are at the Children's Hospital, helping with the MRDD children at their school, at the dog shelter, etc.

those may be boring, nasty etc, but just always know you're doing something by helping your community.
