Dear Principal

I think we should perform community service to support our community to help out clean our streets, and parks and help the people who are starving for food . All students should require to help out with the animals and the people from starvation. It doesn't take time off of you want to do It would help out to make our place a whole lot better than a mess. Its important to help out our community to live in a better place to live. The people who need food you can donate to the people who are starving out there right now. Also You can donate to you're charity to help out the homeless that are starving to eat and donate for the winter of the cold because they might be cold and with no food they can start dying. You can clean up with the littering its not right for the animals to eat our plastic it can kill them and start to clean you're streets.
