Im going to tell about how the author of the article ''The Challenge of Exploring Venus" is trying to convince people to explore and stuying one of our 8 plants called "Venus". He starts off by geeting in detail with describing how vevus is by stating " Venus sometimes caleed the Evening Star,is one of the brightest points of light in the night sky,and saying venus is the second plant fro our sun. Earth in terms of density and size,and occasionally the closet in distance too. He also discribed the plant as a cloud-draped world, and says maybe this issue explains why not a single spaceship has touched downn on venus in more than three decades

The author also gets into some math into this by breaking down some percentages that venus has compared to other plants by saying. "A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets venus ". he also says that one the plants surface , temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and theatmosphere pressure is 90 times gretaer than what they have experienced on earth. Venus has the hottest surface tempertature of many plants in our solar system, even with mercury being closer to the sun. He basically telling us about the percentages and the deepest amont of venus and other plants we didnt reaserch about.

In more of the storyhe tells you the things yo are exprcted to see on venus. Venus was covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life,just like earth. The planet has a surfae of rocky sediment and includes familiar features suck as valleys, mountains, and craters. He changes the subject and goesminto the NASA and how they have ideas on sending humas to study venus. he describes how going out there would be like by saying imagine a blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above theroiling venusian landscape. Also at thirty plus miles above the surface, temperatures would still be toasty around 170 degrees fahrenheit, but tha air pressure would be close to that of sea level on earth
