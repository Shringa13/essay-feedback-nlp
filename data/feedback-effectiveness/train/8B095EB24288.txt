Students would be benefit from being able to attend to classes from home because some students have to work, they have family, and others live far away.

First of all students would be benefit from being able to attend to classes from home because some have to work and they dont have time to attend to school because of their schedule.

Second reason is that students would be benefit from being able to attend to classes from home because they have family, that could be a problem for them since they could have kids and have to take care of them and being able to study from their houses it's a great a option for them.

And last reason, because others live far away. sometimes students dont have transportation because of their location or maybe they don't even have school in the area, and online classes it's an good advantage for them and good opportunity to study.

In conclusion online courses have many great opportunities and good advantage for students, and some of the reasons are: because some students have to work, they have family, and others live to far away.
