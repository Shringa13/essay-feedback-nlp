Being a part of the Seagoing Cowboys was a great experience. I had no idea that it would be as much fun as it turned out to be. For me, this opportuninty meant being able to witness extraordinary places, while being able to help others. For others and yourself it could mean just the same.

I had a great deal of fun on my trip. It gave me an opportunity to see many countries that I may not have seen on any other basis, such as Venice, Italy as well as parts of China, Europe, and Greece. I also chose to spend my off time playing sports and games whenever the chance came along. Your down time; however, would be entirely up to you though, but these are some unique places and things to consider exploring.

My down time was not the most important part of the trip though. It also gave me an opportuntiy to aid others as well as animals, who's homes where left in ruins. After getting this chance to so something more in my life, I knew that this was a great thing that I had invested my time into.

Extensively, I would recomend this as a career path to any who are interested. The years that I was a Seagoing Cowboy, were a great few years in my life. I am very proud of the choice that I had made to do it. This choice changed my life in most every aspect. It opened my eyes to the world and could do the same for you.
