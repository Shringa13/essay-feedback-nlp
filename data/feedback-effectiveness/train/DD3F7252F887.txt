Facial action coding sytsem should be used because it is a good way to help students and people, First off i think if this is being used on students it is a really good idea because some students be needing help and they are to scared to ask for help and in this way the computer can help and make the lesson easy for the students this might give the students moure confidence of doing something and trying. Also if a student is bored this will make the lesson not as boring as it is for the student. This is a good way to help people to what if they are going through something and they need help or want to talk to somebody but dont want to tell anybody the facial action coding can let somebody know and friends or family can take action. Plus it is cool because you can find out alot of things about old pictuers, Like if you want to find out or just see how somebody is feeling you can use that. This is really cool beacsue you can find out alot of feelings on just a picture. Lets talk about the Mona Lisa , they used this on her and found out how she was feeling in that painting. She was feeling happy for the most part but a little bit of other emotions with that. This is a really cool way to communicate with people, This is also a cool way to make movies and video games better and more reall felling you know.? This can sence 44 muscle in your face and will let you know how your felling just of your expression. We have expressions every day but sometimes can be hard to tell how we are feeling. Most people dont know how other people feel but this can let other people understand what they are going through. This can also let people track the emotion they want to know if that person is feeling. Yes i do think that this system should be used. It can help alot. This would be very useful in alot of things.
