In this article i read about "Making Mona Lisa Smile" was about the creator of the art frew how she normally felt which was not so cheerful but more like what she's a normal act she was as half as happy as she was she always was more in a good mood more than a bad. but as i look at the art created by Leonardo da Vinci's i can tell her mood its like a slightly smile but also a i dont care type of person like she's happy but also she can careless whats going on and how things are around her that slight smile on her face shows that she's not always angry but its more of a smerk like something you do when your kinda naughty about something. She's giving like kinda that evil eye. In this picture it also not just about her and her actions but look around her where shes's at look like a lonely river where its a thoughtful place where she can think and for me what sets ut off is the fact that this coloring donest really have any color as much as its just a copy and the real one got a slight color to it not alot of bright out there type of color its more of a "ehh" type like its there but not bright like how they express her feelings shes happy therefor its there but than it dont need to be.
