I agree all students must partticipate in at leasat one extracurricular activity at school, because it's good for them and they can spend more they'er time at school playing sport or doing some other activity like math clup or working on the school yearbook any other cluping or activity, and help student learn more new stuff.

students could leaen more about sports an be healther and know how to play it other thing is that they can do there homework at school if they cant do it at home or if they have no one at the house to help them.

participate at schools activity something that all school should have and make students have a better guatction in there furcht and help how to become good person later in life.

The most importent thing about participate to school activity is you can spend time with your friend and teacher and your principal too, and it help students with there grades too.

Not all students have or must participate to school activity, but is there choses rather they want to or not but i thing is impoent to partticipate an actiticy at school is for there good.Â
