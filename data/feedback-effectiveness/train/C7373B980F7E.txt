Why call it extracurricular when you are required to do it? I disagree that you have to stay after school because what if you have a job,parents are divorced ,have no time to chill with friends, and if you have to walk home with your siblings.

What if you have a job then you would not be able to sat after. The reason why you can't stay after is if you have a job you have to get ready, you have to take a shower. You might even have to do choirs if your parents give you some when you come home from school then you have to leave for work and on top of that you might have to do homework.

What if your parents are divorced. If your parents are divorced then then you might not be able to see your mom and your dad as much. Without being able to see your parents as much that will leave you and your parents depressed do to the mental health problems that occurs when your parents divorce.

If you are required to stay after school then you wont have as much time to hang out with your friends. When you are at school for so long you get anxious because all you are doing is traveling to room to room all day then they add even more time to the day its just bound to have more frequent fights. But not only that you dont get to see your friends as much because by the time you are getting home its becoming dark outside.

When you have to stay after you can't walk your siblings to your house. The nice thing about getting off ealer then the elementary school kids is when you get out of school you can walk to there school then wait for your siblings. But if you are required to stay after school then you cant walk them to the house which would mean that they would walk by them self or a parent would have to quit there job to make sure there child gets home safely.

In conclusion, You should not make it required to stay after school because we might have a job,parents that are divorced,wont have much time to chill, and our siblings might have to walk there house by them self.
