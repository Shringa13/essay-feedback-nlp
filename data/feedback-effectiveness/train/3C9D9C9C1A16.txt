In "The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"the author suggests that studying planet Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangerous it presents. Since Venus is the closet planet to Earth in terms of density and size, the distance are similar too. This planet has different speeds. Though, humans have sent many spacecrafts to this dangerous land. Each mission was unmanned sicne no spacecraft ever survived the landing for a few hours.

Some dangerous this planet planet presents are, the atmosphere is thick and is almost 97 percent of carbon dioxide. The clouds are highly corrosive sulfuric acid in the atmosphere and the conditions are more extreme than human encounter in Earth. "Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solor system, even though Mercury is closeer to our Sun"(Paragraph 3). It has so much heat and pressure and the weather presents additional dangerous which are, erupting volcanoes,powerful earthquakes, and excesive amount of lighting strikes.

This dangerous can really affect humans and humans won't really be able to survive in that planet. Scientists believe Venus was once covered largely wiht oceans and could of supported forms of life. Since scientists are now able to knwo more about technology and ivent new spacecrafts. We now have new information of the Planet Venus. Now, we know it's surface is rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters.

In conclusion, I think the more we learn the more we can be able to experience more things and have more knwoledge. Technology has been playin a big part of this situations and expriences. The more technology advances the more we will be able to exprience more.
