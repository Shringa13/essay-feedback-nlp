Dear Principal,

I think that you should choose Policy 1 because a lot of parents text their children either when they will be picked up or if they are going to be late. Also if you don't have phones at school and a parents tells the student that they will be here at three but they were late, then the student would be waiting outside for a long time until his/her mom or dad came to pick them up. In addition, if a student is really sick and needs to go home, they can call their mom or dad on their cell phone. For example, I got sick in school once and I felt so bad, so I went to my locker and called my mom and asked her to pick me up from school. Another reason why we should have Policy 1 is that if you get sick and have to use the school phone to contact your parent, then you would have to remember your mom's or dad's number, and if you didn't then you can't go home and you have to toughen out the rest of the day. In addition, if you can have your cell phone in school then you can communicate to your family if something has happened to someone or you forgot something. Also if you forget something at home, then you can use your phone to see if your mom or dad would go back and get it for you. In addition, when the school has a jeans day, but you forget you can call your mom or dad to get your some casual clothes for you. If you enforce the rule more and give out detentions and take away the phones if the student is using it in class, then maybe some of the students would pay more attention to the rule and not use their phone during class. That is why I think that you should use Policy 1.
