Should the Electroal College be removed? Thats been the arguments, talks, and thoughts over many years. If they we'er to ask me, I would absolutly say "Yes The Electroal College should be removed." But many people ask "why?", to me it's simple. All the votes that "U.S Citizens" make every four years, never really goes directly to the runners for presidents. They always go to people who decide weather or not they should be approved, wich abviously the should if their whole or majority of the state voted for him/her. But thats not what the the feel, they feel like they need to aprove the runners. "why?", you ask? I'm not sure. If they need to do all that, why dont the people of the House Of Representatives just make their decisions? Since it always come down to them, then there's no point of the U.S Citizens voting for president. But then agian, I feel like why should they choose who is the president? If the whole USA are the one's who need to worry about the president.
