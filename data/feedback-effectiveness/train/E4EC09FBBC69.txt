If i had to write an essay arguing whether the use of this technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable, it would be like this, i would say that it is really valuable because they are telling us what emotions really mean, what they can or just do for us and just why emotions are important to us, in a way that it really matters. First, here are the real main reasons that they really matter and they are, First, its like when you are doing a test, you are really focused on it, you will get really stressed on it and might not know what to do at all and you might need help on it, so the computer could tell if you were stressed and that you didn't know waht to do at all. there are many reasons why and this second reason is its like when your science teacher is grading your lab assignment and you are with your partner and you might be just getting it done or just got it done right away or just maybe worked on it really slow and needed help, well the computer would be able to help you with that. Some people might say that the (FACS) is not valuable and just isn't smart because it might not get the correct percent or because it might not do everything or just a few things wrong, but that doesn't mean that also doesn't mean that it might do a lot of things right either. The last thing that i am going to say that i am arguing that the use of technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom, is this, like if a computer knows if you are happy or sad, it would do this, it would pull up an ad one might be sad and then the other one would be exciting and just make you happy in a way that you didnt know that you could be happy about something, for example, like a bunch of puppies,cats, someone just getting there drivers license and then getting a new car, something like that. Bad and sad things would be like this, it would be like someone who smokes to much or someone who just passes away, just stuff like that, and i would just feel really bad for you and would just want to help you in any way that i could. So those aere the reasons that i would want a use of technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom that is valuable.
