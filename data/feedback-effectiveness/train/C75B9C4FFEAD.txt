Home school is a benefit that anybody could have. Taking school at home would be better if you ask me, but it is not for everybody though.

Being home schooled is better then regular school because you got all day to do your work. Some people don't work as fast as others and need to work at a different pace. If you're home schooled you can watch TV and relax while doing your work at the same time, if you can multi-task. But Sometimes it could be a distraction from you doing all your work.

For an example, If you do home school you dont have to worry bout waking up early in the morning. People like me are not a morning person. Also if you missed the bus to school and got no transportation you're gonna be stuck at home. School could be on the other side of town and walking would take too long.

Attending classes online would give you the benefit of getting through school faster. Doing home school will help you graduate 2x faster then usual if you doing all your work right. My brother was home schooled for 2 years and graduated at six-teen. Another thing is you can look up answers online to your work.

When you get home schooled you dont have to worry about teachers telling you what to do, but until you get that video call on your laptop. You can pull out your phone and talk without somebody saying " Put your phone up and stop talking". But sometimes your teacher that assigns your work will have a group conference call with you and a few otherÂ people in the online classes you got.

Home school is better there's some downfalls for it. If you dont study and just look up everything online. Also you aint gonna have no friends to talk to nd joke around with while you doin your work. If your attention spand short home school is not for you.
