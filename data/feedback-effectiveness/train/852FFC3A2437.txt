In my opinion, Im against of the value of using technology to read students emotional expresses. Not every student wants another person nor even technology to know what their emotions are. I believe all people go threw something in life and that they just want to keep that something a secret. I also believe that in life we have to go threw a path on our own ; there would be sacrifice , tears and smiles but its apart of growing up and facing reality. Not everyone gets the same amount of help as the other person. Some people just need their worth to try living on their own. A bunch of students dont have a mom , dad or they dont even have both. Some student live their lifes without parents , who will they be able to trust ? In this article , I believe other people like this idea that their willing to help people out but some people rather just face their problems on their own. Dont get me wrong though . Its quiet an amazing work for actresses that are willing to improve their acting skills; It has quiet pontiental that they invented a 3-D computer to identify mixed emotions.
