The new technology is very helpful showing about whats more to a picture or a frame. Why is this important well beacuse people want to know about more about the picture or of what the picture is showing for example, Mona Lisa smile to not be so serious in the picture imagine having a cute picture but your so serious. You can change that with new tecnology. Comperters are very helpful theses days in many ways. For example it can be useful for making payments , searching up information you need , paperwork, photoshop, diffrent apps that are useful on making your life better. Its a better sorce of seaching stuff up learning more about the world and the physics. Theres more to this i mostly use it for searching up information about the topic i want to learn about. Its easier for me beacuse i dont like rreading alot and i can just look up videos instead of having to sit there for an hour looking up information or reading it beacuse reading makes me sleepy. Thats why i think the web is an awsome resorse for people that need to be informed and thought many diffrent things.

Many people use this method by making there photogrophy work look better than it is. Its a very good sorce for people that have the job as a photographer beacuse they will make everything work in many ways. For example if something in the picture gets in the way the computer will show u how to get rid or it instead of doing all the extra stuff on taking a whole lot of pictures that look the same or worst. Why waist your time on doing that instead get the app or the program and get to steping its way better and easier to get pictures that are perfect.
