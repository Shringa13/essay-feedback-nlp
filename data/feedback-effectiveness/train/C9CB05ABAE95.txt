Dear principal,

I believe that you should select your first policy. If students can have there phones out during free time and lunch periods than they will be less likely to use try and use the in class. During school kids complain that they are not able to use there cell phones at all in school, but if they could use them during free times than they could talk with friends then and not have a need to during class. Think of what would happen if you go with the second policy, students will try and talk to friends during your teachers classes. When the students use there cell phones in classes they worry more about number one, getting caught and number two being able to talk to there friends. Most schools worry that students that have internet capability will post mean things about other students on social networking sites. You cant stop students from posting it at there homes, so they will do it there instead so you cant prevent that from happening.

If you select the alternative policy, and not the first policy than students would not be allowed to have them of use at school at all. If they were not to be of use than students would make it a game or a competition to see who can text the longest without getting caught by the teacher. It would be better to have them at use in school because than students that want to learn can and the students that don't want to learn repeat the same classes until they pay attention enough to pass there class.

Not being able to have a cell phone out at any time of the school day would be a bad idea. Having cell phones out during free time in the day would be a much better selection. Having cell phones out during class is a bad idea, but during their free time is there free time to do anything they want that is school appropriate.
