I am strongly against driverless cars. I feel that whoever came up with the idea must have had some bad food or something. I wonder what encouraged them to even have the thought of a car driving itself. Having driverless cars will most likely end the human population. I am saying this because it makes me think of the movie Wall-e.

In the movie Wall-e there is a robot named Wall-e and earth is deserted or so wall-e thinks. One day Wall-e was doing his normal routine when he stumbled upon a pretty robot named Eve. Wall-e and Eve go on a journey to find her home/ ship, and when they do it is filled with humans. Wall-e is suprised to see the humans he thought they all were dead. Every human that he sees is sitting in a chair that can move them aournd to where ever they want, and get them whatever they want. They don have to get up for anything or physically move their musles. All of the people are obese. People die from obesity, obesity can cause heart problems which can cause a heart attack. Which can make you die. This is only a chair, imagine what it would be like if it was a car.

It would be pointless for adults and teenagers to get lisence. It would be pointless to have rules of the road. Everything that has restriictions, or policies on drivers and their driving would be pointless and useless. As of now we our try to stop drinking and driving. If a car drove itself few crashes but the number lives that are taken will be the same. Peopel can die from alcohol poisoning. Even now cars have malfunctions, what if the driverless car runs into another car because it couldnt stop. A few years ago a lady was on the interstate and her breaks weren't working. The emergency break wasn't even working, and she was going aroung 70 miles per hour. She only had control over the steering wheel. People wont have control over the steering wheel of the driverless car descides to malfunction. Many lives could be taken because of it. This is why i am against driverless cars.
