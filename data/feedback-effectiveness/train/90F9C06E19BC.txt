I think that people should be able  to use there own car when they to for there to get around aleats lower gas prices so people want be in there cars much as they u to be. Some people need to use there cars for the onlu way for transpartion to get doctors and dentisis appoinments they can also use there cars less because there wasting valuable resources in world because gas makes the car so that a valuavble resources we need to keep so maybe if people stay out thers cars it will make the gases prices go down they you can use for only if really need if you the car as a emgercy.

Why are there no cars on Vaubans street but expect there are only a few down town in but thats only if you are ride the tram to get around. I think every state should have a trams and bus and bullets trains to get them to one  to another that would totally cut out the numbers of cars you will see on the so why not consider trying a new idea to get cars off the road maybe invent something that will occupie peoples so they want have to you there cars to get around I am try it and see though it might be good thing to do.

Why do people by more than one car its only one of them and mulitiply cars so why waste money more than one car when you can sell your for things that are important like paying a bill or get gorcery for you house or just helping otherss out so i thing that dumb for peole to have more than one car if you are not going to use the cars all time I understand that celebrites haves mulitiply cars because they show them but the car usage is still high but people can do what evere they want with there money who I am just a boy i coming telling you people with more than car is really really ricdulious to but hey I am going sit back and let people use up there gas in there so be it.
