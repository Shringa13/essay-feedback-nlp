In the article "Making Mona Lisa Smile," the author talks and describes to us this new technology that can detect how you feel and can tell you about your emotions just by looking at your facial traits. It identifies six basic emotions-hapiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness. This kind of a technology has many good and positive effects attached to it.

This technology allows us to know how a person is feeling or allows us to know how a person was feeling when a picture was taken. For example,"She's 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent happy." This evaluation of emotion is from the painting of Mona Lisa, painted by Leonardo Da Vinci. Even though it was just a picture or a painting, this technology identified all sorts of emotion. There could be several other instances when this new emotion-recognition sofware could come in handy. For instance, we could tell if our friend is happy or sad, if they are lying or not, if they are disgusted or not. This could either strenghten our friendship or maybe break our friendship and so with this, we can detect/identify a lot of things.

This can be very useful for the media to detect when someone is lying. This new invention tells us that faces never lie. For example,"these muscle clues are sometimes used to spot when when a smiling politician or celebrity isn't being thruthful." This can help the media or the news channel's to give the most accurate information and all the bias can stop. This on the other hand has many other benefits to it.

This new technology can solve a lot of historic and present questions. It just uses your facial traits to recognize your emotions. This in turn leads to the finding of answers to several other questions that have not been answered or have unsure answers to them.
