Dear Principal:

I believe that cell phones are something that people need to have sometimes for example say one student missed the bus and needs to get a ride home but all of his friends are gone and the school is locked. He has no option but to call home and have his parents come get him. I think that policy 1 is a good idea and that they need to have them but they need to be off or in a locker protected from other students but not a problem to the teacher and the student. Phones can interrupt many thing like dinner with family or study time for a big test that is coming up. People sometimes use cell phones to often for example some kid is trying to do a book report but his friend is in the library fake reading a book and texting him. Neither one of them can concentrate. Texting in class is a problem and it need to stopped. It has caused many grades to drop and many kids to get into trouble. Calling is sometimes necessary to the kid that has to find a way to get hame or to contact a parent to let them know where they are and what they are doing and to inform them so they don't get worried. That is why i go for school policy 1 because sometimes the phones are needed.
