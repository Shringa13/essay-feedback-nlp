This is a vey informative article but i would like to list most of the key ideas inside of it. i would like to inform of the positive and negatives

In the article there are many diffrent forms of evidence towards using this new technology in the classroom but i feel that some stick out more than others. In parargraph 6 the author told of the technology using our facial expressions to calculate whether we are bored or confused and i feel that,that is a very good idea. As a high school student i can relate to the lesson getting boring, confusing, or just too fast pace. I feel that if this machine was used to help make an ideal lesson plan for each student the percentage of students passing would increase. I would love to have something as inovative as this technology inside of my schools classrooms.

I do support this but ; however, there is some things about this that do concern me as a student. Some students could be angered by the use of this new technology and want their old lesson plans back. Some students like the fast paced lesson plan and will get bored of the change. in some communitys this would not be avaliable due to money problems. For the time being i think we should leave the schools how they are until we can finally bring this in for students in the future when its more avalible to everyone.

In conclusion i feel that we should just leave everything as it is in our schools. i feel that the lesson plans have worked for over 60 years and they will continue working. i like the idea but i feel that its too ahead of some schools with low money.
