The student don't need there emotion's expressed some like it hidden.

Computers don't need to understand what humans feel because they don't have feelings. The computers are using emotions and the way we look at the computer to see if we know what we are doing if we don't the computer will make it easier on us so we will understand what is going on.

The main idea is about the science of emotions and not a lot of the people care about there emotions but sometimes it is important to learn about ur emotions even if we don't want to because sometimes we could use the work of why we use so much emotions when we talk to people or even taking the trash out we all still use emotions but why do we.

in conclusion the whole story is about the science of emotions it lets everyone know if we are mad or sad even angry and sometimes people help out with getting ur anger down but not all the time does ur anger go down sometimes it stays up because you won't let anyone help you. our emotions are hard to hide but sometimes it helps like when ur mad but don't want to show it but you also want to show it because you want the person to leave you alone or put down something that i already yours.

body: some people use a stress ball to calm down and not a lot of people use it because they think it is for babys but some people need it if they can't keep there anger in check everyone needs to keep there anger in check if not there anger will get the best of them and then they will be getting in a whole lot of trouble from letting there anger get the best of them the best way to make sure you don't get angry is just to find something you like to do and do it then just put headphones on so you can just mute them and can't hear anything if they mess with you then go somewhere they won't go.
