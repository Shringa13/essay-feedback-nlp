Policy 2 would be better because if you can have cell phones out during school it is distracting you from what you are learning. If you had your phone out during lunch you could accidentally drop it and break it. It would be a better chance for someone to steal it. What is the point to call someone during class anyway, they have phones in school to call with.

They can have phones in school but off in your locker or pocket. School is meant for learning stuff not talking to your friends or texting to them. You can text them or call them after school. Having a cell phone in school and if your texting it takes time from learning from you, so if you have a big test and the teacher went over the stuff with you guys and you were texting and not paying attention you could get a bad grade on the test. But what is the point kids texting anyway in class when they are not apposed to.

I could see if you were after school and you had to call your mom or somebody to pick you up. But what is the point of having your phone out, if you were walking and texting you get walk into somebody and get hurt walking into something like a wall. If you don't have a cell phone people are going to make fun of you more. It will be a competition to see who has the better phone.
