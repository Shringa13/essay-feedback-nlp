the author is right in this passage because in paragraph 8 nassa is trying to shut down all the towers and the author about this story he wishes nassa could go away but that will be inpossonle these differences from nassa are in speed mars and other times to venus because venus is sometimes around the corner cloud drapped world each previous mission is unmanned and for a good reason cause nassa can handle there men unmanned they all survied the landing for more than a few hours. Maybe this issue explains why venus spaceship hasnt touched down in almost 3 decades. So nassa is concerned about venus spaceship. A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets venus. if our sister planet is so inhospitable why are scientists even discussing futher visits to its surface there wasting there time for all the importanty of nassa....the surfce was rockey and couldnt be walled on because of that reason or drove on there was mountains and craters furthermore. the nationL aeronautics and space administration (NASA) has one particularly compelling idea for sending humans to study venus.
