Here's why the author thinks Venus is a worthy pursuit because Venus could of once been a Earth like planet. Venus is same size in density, and size as Earth. The planet had rocky sediments, craters, valleys, and mountains. But nobody can visit or get a up close look to venus because it has a thick atmosphere of almost 97% carbon dioxide, highly corrosive clouds of sulfuric acid in its atmosphere. The weather is extremely hot the average temperature is about 800 degrees Fahrenheit. The atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than we are experiencing right now on earth this is stronger than any sea level on earth. If we were to have another pursuit to Venus it would not be efficient because we dont have the right equipment to survive on that kind of journey. No, the author did not evaluate his idea good enough there wasn't enough supporting details to support his claim "Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents".
