This might be a good way to help stop school shootings. You can identify which studnet needs help and can go and talk to that student . Being able to read emotions can be helpful but it may also be distracting. For example" the student appering unintrested and or bored and it automanically changes to a video game" ? Some student are special needs or may be thinking about something happing at home or maybe what's for lunch ? , and the next thing they see is their work has been erased and or changed and they can do nothing about it and send them into a panick attack and can not focus on anything except trying to calm down. Im both with and against this .

We have a right to privacy unless there is a reason for worry. This could possibly assist students who have a undetected disorder or possibly prevent school shootings . We should have a personal right not to reveal are emotions if we do not want to , but i think if there is a cause for worry on certain students than maybe we could try it.
