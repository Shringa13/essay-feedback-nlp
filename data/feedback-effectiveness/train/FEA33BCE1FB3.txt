The author emphasis how studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents is very important to Astronomers. "The Challenge of Exploring Venus" mainly supports how Venus is worth the riskand challenge to explore to see if it's as much like Earth as it's said to be, because it is close to Earth in size and density, has similiar geographics, and is known as Earth's sister planet.

First, Venus is set up with similar distancing as Earth it's sometimes often referred to as "Earth's twin". The text says that "Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size, and occasionally the closest in distance too." Venus is so similar to Earth, but yet so challenging to explore.

Second, just like Earth Venus has mountains and valleys. Some might even say long ago there were oceans, because the text says "Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life,just like Earth."

Then, Venus is known to be Earth's sister planet! Venus has always been the closest planet to Earth other than Mars, but if Venus is so much like Earth astronomers can't figure out why it's so much more inhospitable than Earth.

In conclusion, Venus is a very challenging place to see and be. Venus has not been touched in more than 30 years! In the text it says ".. not a singlr spaceship has touched down on Venus in more than three decades." So although Venus is the sister of Earth astronomers know very little about her. So they keep in pursuit to learn more despite the dangers it presents everytime.
