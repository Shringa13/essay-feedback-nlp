The author has said that NASA has three pictures from the red planet. In the pictures is a face, from three different years (1976, 1998, 2001). The last picture has a clear image of the face. It has a cracked eye and to the left side.

This is a rock that had just been formed like this. It had been forming to look like this for years. If it had not been discovered what would we think about the red planet. The planet would just be another planet close to earth.

If we could get a human on the red planet that would be great. We can't do that yet. It will not happen for another 400 to 500 years. This is a long wait time, but in the end it is all going to be worth every hour put in.

The red planet has many mysteres we will never know. This one will be around for years to come. The next generation will find out if life is out there. If they find it make contact.
