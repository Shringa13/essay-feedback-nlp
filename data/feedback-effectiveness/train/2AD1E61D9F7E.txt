It's very fun and educational to travel. Luke was a solider in World War 1 and he was stationed in Europe,during this time war was going on and this wasn't the best time to visit there. But it's a more safe invorment and is known for it's history including the "World War 1". When you've had a lot going on at work, just want to do something nice for the kids,or even just tired of the weather a vaction is perfect for many reasons such as the ones I've mentioned. It's also very easy to become stressed and overwheled by work and school;its just best to take a break for it all. You can just go to a beach on an tropical Island or a jungle then come back to a fresh start ready to go,before you know you'll already be planing your next trip back or somewhere esle. You'll also get to meet new people around the world maybe you'll decide to move there. These are simple reasons why its great to travel hopfully you'll concider it.
