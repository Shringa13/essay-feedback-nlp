I'm not for driverles cars because they can still cause an accident and if any person could, Also there not really driving the car itself but is helping out the driver by stop when they are not looking or if there is a green light then, the car will alert the driver to press the gas if they are distacted. But, it will not drive a person home if they are drunk. There are better ideas then making a driving car. But, instead of buidling drivierless cars we can save the enviroment. They can make the world a better places but make fuel efficeny cars instead of driverless cars. Make trucks not run on diesel we can be doing so much more than making a driverless car. What if the car computer programming chip is damage then that means that the car can't be able to work correctly and that the car is in a higher risk of getting more people in danger because of the driverlesss car.

Building a driverles car is going to be very expensive. And we are not in a lot of debt so we should use are money wisely.
