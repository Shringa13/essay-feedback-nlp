Some countryes do not have the right for vote for who they whant to be president, and the candidate who gets to be the president takes the freedom and security of any person who oppose to him.

It is not fair that something like that could star to thake place in the United States. This country is for the ones that are looking for freedom to have the right to argue their way of thinkind and express, in a good way.

We have the right to know the candidate's potential, knowledge, way of thinking, how he will governate the United States, hir goal for this country, his expectatives, and if he is able to be a leader. Because if we do not have the right to vote, our way of thinking and our rights is not important. The country depends on the persons who live in there, too. There has to be an agreeement  between the citizens, because there has to be a leader who can be able to defend the country and citizens.

The Electoral Collage does not has a democratic method of selectiong a president, and if there is a tie in electoral vote, the election would be thrown to the House of Representatives , where state delegations vote on the president and the Senate would choose the vide-president.

The Electoral Collage is unfair to voters, outdated, and irrational. The disaster factor was the biggest election crisis, and considerinf that the state legislatures are are responsable for picking the electors.

The Electoral Collage method of selecting the president may turn off potential voters for candidate who has no hope of carrying their state.

The people needs that the president can have the potential to carry the state.
