Dear principal,

The policy i believe is better is policy one. I believe this policy is better because if we keep our phones off during class for free time or lunch we should be able to use them. I think we should use them because since its free time its not gone to hurt any body to. Another good reason to use them is because instead of kids talking during class, they would much rather texting or calling there friends that's not nearby.

Another opportunity for kids being on their cell phones during free hour is that if they have a love one or somebody that needs to be called then they can call them right then and there, like if they need to check on there sibling if there home by them self. Another way cell phones can be useful is if they need to call there parents to see what they need to do when they get home from school, instead of walking all the way to the office to call somebody important.
