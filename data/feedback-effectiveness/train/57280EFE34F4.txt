I am doing a essay about technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable. I dont think technology can tell someone in emotes by scanning their face. It cant go thou are mind and say they are feeling sad. Us humans can tell if they are sad or happy because we have been thou the same things they are going thou.

If it is true I would not use because if they are using it as a govement weapon to find if some one is hinding some well needed things and they start to used this and if it gives them wrong information that person might be in some trouble. And the other way around if they have some need information and the FACS or Facial Action Coding System just lost it.

If it can do this. This thing will be ahead in technology and clear a path for us in the near furture. But I dont blieve this computer can tell people feelings. First how big is it? Is it the size of a gym or is it as small as a Iphone 4? This computer is just a big fake.

Second how much does it cost? Is it the same to build it as much as a lamborigini or as much as a pencil? Third, how long does it take to build it. And how long does it last for. 1 minites or 3 hours. How long does it scan for.
