Becoming a Seagoing Cowboy has a lot of ups and downs but the ups are accually pretty cool like;

You might find an uncharted island and make a lot of money off of it. You would see interesting and cool places while you were travleing to the destination. I have always wanted to go to Ireland but i dont think that i will ever go there... Unless i become a SeaGoing Cowboy of corse!

You get a lot of excersise by traveling a lot. If you are the kind or person who really likes to travel, then you would like to be a SeaGoing Cowboy. You get a chance to be on a boat in the open sea. I would really like to be a SeaGoing Cowboy because your always out at sea and i love the ocean, i could live on the ocean if I could.

You would try new things on the on the way like you would land on countries or islands that you have always wanted to go to. You might also get respect from the other landgoers. I mean, who wouldn't like to have respect from other people! (Plus you get an awesome name) "Seagoing Cowboy" sounds cool huh? Yeah.

So try it, it might be your kind of thing, or maybe you could just sit around at home doing dishes, chopping logs or something, Who knows maybe you will become a SeaGoing Cowboy one day.
