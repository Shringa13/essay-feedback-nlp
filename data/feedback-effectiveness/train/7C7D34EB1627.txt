What i think is better is to have the phones off in class because if it rings or vibrates your going to be distracted and your not going to focus on your work and your going to end up calling your friend and laughing loud and he/she is not going to listen on what the homework assignment is or what they have to do for the class work this is why you have to keep your cell phones off in class. then later this wont happen to you and always be focus in school and focus on your friends later school goes first for you could get a good job. and if they want to decide if they want to have their cell phones on in class is not going to be better for the teachers because they cant help the students learn and what is going on in life and what do they have to do as their assignment. they want to be texting in class and be distracted.

Only one person will always make a difference in life if they do something wrong the other person needs to come in and say that they didn't do that, they didn't text in class he/she was paying attention then later the teacher asks them a question and they don't know the answer to the question and thats when they catch them that they were texting or talking so is better off keeping the phones off or on silent for it won't make any noise and you will be focus in school more and you will get your grades up higher and will never be distracted until you go home and then you could do all the texting you want to do and never have u grades because of the texting if you have it on vibrate ignore it and continue working on your class work or homework .

When you have a phone and is on make sure you dont show it off to your friends be
