I know for a fact that when I need advice for something I ask a couple members of my family so I get more advice. Have you ever needed advice? Well if you haven't good for you, but most people need advice. It is better to hear a couple different people so you get more information than what you would get from one side.

Have you ever had a tough decision to make? Wouldn't it be better to hear both sides of the story rather than just one? For example, you may be getting bias information if you only take advice from one person. It is better to get information from multiple people so you get a better understanding of what you are learning about.

It's just like teamwork, for example it takes more than one person to play a game of basketball or football. The more people work together the more education people will get. People who hear only one side of the story will have the same information but it is more likely to be bias since it is from only one side. For example I watched a movie the other day and it was about these kids who had to work together to get anything done, and if the didn't work together they got no work done.

Everyone needs assistance every now and then. Like when you fall and someone helps you up, they are assisting you. One time I was on a board at my house and I fell off and broke my leg, but my friend was there and he carried me to the house. He assisted me by helping me to the house.

In conclusion, everyone needs advice at some point in your life. You can get it from anyone including your parents, but the more people you talk to, the more information you will receive. You can always talk to people like you parents, teachers, or even the guidance councilors at your school. No matter who you ask it will be less likely to be bias as long as you ask multiple people.
