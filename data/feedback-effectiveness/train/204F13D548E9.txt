Mars hasn't stayed the same over the years. Mars has changed a lot over the years. And Mars (aka. the red plant) will continue to changed until the end of time.

While we were observing Mars on 1976 with Viking 1 we seen a figure that looked like a human face and that strected 2 miles from end to end. At the Jet Propulsion Lab there had to be a great deal of suprise. Peole started to imidiately think this was created by aliens. That was still to be figured out.

Over the next 25 years scientists studied Mars to determine if this was created by aliens or its just a natural landform. Scientist have been using many different spacecrafts to better understand the "face". The picture of mars had become a pop icon. its was in a hollywood film, in magazines and books.

Mission Controllers prepared to look again. "it's not easy to target Cydonia," says Garvin. "in fact, it's hard work." Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on A JPL website, revealing a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all.
