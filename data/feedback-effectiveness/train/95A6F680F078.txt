dear who ever this may concern, i foundly belive that we should be able to keep the Electoral Collage because it has haelped this far with fairness and making sure that all the votes have been counted at least twice.

But i also see that from where you stand the Electral Collage may be just a waste of money and in some peoples eyes it is. but that doesnt mean that in alls it is. from where is see it if it helps us whyÂ  not keep it even if it doesnt always pan out as planed we all have our problems but that doesnt mean that the government shuts us down it just means that the only reason we have those isssues are because not everything will go according to plan.

it also doesnt mean let it get outta hand then try to real it in as soon as possible the only way this would work is if we had some one who didnt care who won eaither way so long as eveything is fair and not messed with. so what im trying to get at is that we dont always get our way but that doesnt mean we need to shut down the Electoral Collage. According to the 23 amendment the district of columbia is allocated 3 electors and treated like a state for puposes of Electoral Collage. also Richard nixion and Jimmy Carter Bob Dole have agreed on the electoral collage and there not alone.

thank you for your time,
