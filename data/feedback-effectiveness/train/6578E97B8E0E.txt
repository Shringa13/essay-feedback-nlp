Dear Principal,

I recently heard you wanted to change the school policy on sports and other activities, so that only students with a grade average of a B or higher can participate.

First of all i think this is wrong, because then students won't have as many after school activities.

After school activities help occupy students time which makes it less likely for them to get in trouble.

Another reason is that students might also drop out or move schools so they can continue playing sports.

If students don't have sports they are also less likely to get enough exercise which could cause more obesity in the school.

Some students rely on sports as a chance to spend time with their friends, so if sports are cut out they may become antisocial and have no friends.

When people play sports it also makes them more motivated to do other things and gain more friendships.

Other activities in which students may not be able to participate in such as electives or school clubs may drop the self esteem of students due to lack of friends with similar interests.

this rule might also cause bullying because if someone can't play sports then others will know they have less than a B average.

Getting regular physical activity in a friendly surrounding also helps people who might have had a troubled past.

When others around to support one and other it also brings up the moods of possibly depressed people.

When activities are available it also helps students broaden their horizon by letting them try things they might not have otherwise tried.

it also allows students to meet people with similar interests.

This policy might also be good because it would give students with poor grades a reason to bring their grades up to atleast a B average.

It also could allow there to be more academic centered clubs.

The students who aren't eligible to play sports could also have tutors in the time they aren't spending on sports.
