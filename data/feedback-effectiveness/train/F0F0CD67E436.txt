This technology to read and find out the emotinal expressions of students is crazy and weird. Its spooky how looking at Mona Lisa picture can express yoiur emotions. Shes actually smiling, but if your mad she'll look mad. So creepy how that works. I feel like they should'nt of told us that. Now when we look and think so deep about this picture we can be frightened, in our dreams or whenever.

Its talking about shes 83% happy and the rest of percentages are mad, sad and all them emotional feelings. They said with this software they can caculate emotions. The picture in the software uses 44 major muscles, and the model must move like a human.

This is kinda smart to caculate emotions, and empressive with the picture where it really moves with 44 major muscles and tells you your emotions. Its true how we can tell how somebody feels by thier face expression, but not evreybody shows it. Some people must be going throught the roughest time in their life and still smile through it. So not everything can work. I like how the the software of Mona Lisa is really intended to bring a smile to your face, but sometimes it could creep you out.
