Dear principle,

I don't think u should make the students of our school do community service because that will take away there time if its after school or there learning time if its during school. it would also be to hard to make all of the students of the school to do that the school could use its time to help the school. Even though it helps the community out by making it a cleaner and safer place the students should have a choice in what they want to do for their community.

If we had to do community service during school it would take time away from our learning and the students need as much time as they can in school to learn what they are doing so they can pass tests and pass the grade. If it was after school it could take time away from the students doing their homework, because most of the students have to do their homework after school and help clean their house. If they are in a sport also they wouldn't have enough time to help the community if it was mandatory.

It would also be to much work to try and monitor all of the students that are at the school to make them do community service. The school could put that time they spent into helping out the school and making the school a better place for the students so they could have a better place to learn.
