I do not like the idea of driverless cars, becuase i have a lack of trust of computers. I'm old fashioned and prefur to have a human being control a machine. If i have to put my child's life into someone elses hands it would not be a computer. Now I am not saying the machine can not do it's job. I am siply saying in my opinion there are to many things that could go wrong.

Someone could hack it for instence. They could run the vehicle of the road, or ey sencers could nowfunction. Say you are going down the road and a little kid runs out infront of you. In a regular car in i can brerak every time, but in a driverless car if the fuse is bad or a wire is loose it may not tivate the breaking system, becuase the sencer was not working. Now imagion for me if you will that kid that ran out in the road was your own child. Young and inocennt with so much life before him/her. Would you really want a driverless car to be the one it ran out infront of?

Now I know people do not always drive safe or pay attention eather, if we inforced the laws we already have in place to protect or children and others. We could make the streets and eventually our beautiful nation safe once more, becuase today our nation is in to big of a hurry, and we forget what it means to take it slow and enjoy life. So i say no. We do not need driverless cars becuase it would only end badly.
