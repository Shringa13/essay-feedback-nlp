Dear Principal,

I think you should allow students to bring their phones to school and use them during study halls and lunch periods. Students really might need their phones, and if they couldn't bring their phones to school and use them at all, then they all would need to use the school phone. If everyone wanted to use the school phone, then they would have to take turns in using it for only a certain amount of minutes.

If a kid does get caught using a cell phone in class, then teachers can take their phones away.. just theirs'. If we don't have our phones at school, then just think about all of the downs, and complaining their would be! I don't think you want that though. Let us be able to take our phones and use them! We won't want to get our freedom from them, so we won't text in class. If some people get caught, then they should get their's.

Sincerely,
