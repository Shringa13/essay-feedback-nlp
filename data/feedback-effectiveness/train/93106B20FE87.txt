dear principal, i believe that the students of this school should be required to do community service. i believe so because even if they don't want to they should still have to. doing community service helps learn about the responsibilities of being an adult. it does this by teaching them that you don't always need to get something in return for what you do. it also can help build self-esteem, because it makes you feel good about helping your town and the people in it. it also allows you to pass high school because there is a required amount of hours of community service to graduate from high school. that is important because if you don't graduate from high school you will never be able to go to college and you won't get a good job to support you and a family. that is why i believe you should be required to perform community service.
