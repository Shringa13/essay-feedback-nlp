The Electoral College has many flaws. One of the main ones is that it is unfair.  They should get rid of it because of the unfairness and go to popular voting. The reason this is unfair is becasue of the "winner-take-all system" and how people arent really voting for president but for the slate of electors.

The first reason this is unfair is becasue of the "winner-take-all system". The system is where the electors that chose the winning president gets rewarded when really it was from popular vote. Then it picks who your state's representing candidate will be based on the preident that won.(

Source 1: What is the electoral college?)

Wouldnt you think that the reason we vote for president is to get a reward and satisfaction of your candidate winning? But no thats not how it works instead it's the electoral collge that gets an award instead.

The second reason why it is unfair is beacause when we go every four years to vote for our new pesident we aren't really voting for them we are voting for the slate of electors. In

Source two it mentions Bob Dole saying to abolish the electoral collge and most people will agree with that. It's unfair and not right to people that truly care. It also mentions how some states had most of their people voting for someone else that didnt win because the electoral college took over and voted the other way then popular vote." It's the elctors who elect the president not the people."(

To conclude this mess of being unfair these are the main reasons why people  would love to get rid of the electoral collge and go to poular vote because it is unfair dealing with the "winner-take-all system" and we aren't really voting for the president but instead the slate of electors.
