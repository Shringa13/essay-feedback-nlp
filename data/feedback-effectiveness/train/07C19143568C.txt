Should the electoral college stay! well this is my responds on this topic,Let get started. I think the electoral college should stay because 1 major reason is to let the election have a fair fight. Another reason is that it in our constitution!!.Another important reason is that with out the electoral there would only be 1 side of a vote for ex it just be the congress voting. With the electoral the want it to be equal so nobody goes home felling down cause he didnt have a fair ruling or a fair election. For my 3 reason they help select how many elector on how many state could have witch for ex the 23 amendment of the constitution they allowed columbia to have 3 ..I dont now much but that sound like alot.

4 reason is that each state has his or her on elector. If u havent notice i have said yes they should be hear to do there job as a elector and to do there job as a guy/girl to do there jobs rights. I understand why elector are trying to stay there trying to stay to have a sucessful carrer and do good in life and not be a bum that live on the street or working at mcdonalds. Another good reason is that if it turn into a tie then the house or representatives come into place and they put the thoughts into. A reason to be it unfair the electoral collehe get no credit for what happens they should get alittle for all the hard work they put into. Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for president, but for a slate of electors, who turn elect the president. Who are the elector? They can be anyone not holding public office.
