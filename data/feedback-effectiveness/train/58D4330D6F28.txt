Imagine yourself as a teacher and one of your students clearly skipped your class yesterday and is lying about where they were yesterday, and all you see is a smirk, well what if you could teel if they were lying by a device that could read their facial expression. Well i think it can and should be brought to teachers and schools to really crack doown on well, reckless teenagers.

In paragraph three the passage states, "The process begins when the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face; all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles. Movement of one or more muscles is called an "action unit." Then Dr. Huang relies on the work of psychologists, such as Dr. Paul Eckman, creator of FACS (Facial Action Coding System). Eckman has classified six basic emotions- happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness-and then associated each with characteristic movements of the facial muscles." What this can prove is that the process of expression recognization requires no harm to the face or person and is created by the studies of not only technological professionals, but also psychological preoffesionals as well.

To conclude, it would be a whole lot nicer if teachers and all educators knew what students were really thinking when being taught. And what would be neat is if students also new the real expression teachers made and what they really felt about the students.
