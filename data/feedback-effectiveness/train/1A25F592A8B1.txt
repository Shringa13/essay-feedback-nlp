Dear Senator

I feel that electoral college should stay becuase it set's straight the manege for the peoples votes for the president. Even thow if a tie the election would be thrown to the house of represenatives were they decide on the new president. The electoral college is a process its not a place. It shows that the founding fathers established it for the compromise between elections between the president by a vote in congress. The electoral college consists of 538 electors. Plus a majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the president .It say's in the passage that under the 23rd Amendment of the constiton that the district of colombia is allocated 3 electors and treated like a state for the purposes of electoral college. On many cases 60 percent of voters would perfer a direct election. The electoral college system states that voters vote not for the president,but for a state of eletors who elect the president. I think that they should have the right to elect the president that would make this nation grow stonger not to make mistakes and lead us to problems which they can decide to choose the future of the united states. Many people have diffrent opinions as me but not all will get the same results as they wanted. The effects of the electoral college has been giving us positive values. As we live on since back of the elections day we are still here becuase of thow,s elections it made us who we are american citizions of the USA.History depends on the future rights of the president thats why the electoral college is there to help make that happen.
