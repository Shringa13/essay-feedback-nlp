I am againt the development of driverless cars. Driverless cars need a whole lot of sensors. Radar was a device on a hiltop that cost two hundred million dollars. We should be investing that money on things that are important. For example help people in need, feed the hungry ect. Why woukld anyone want a driverless car that still needs a driver? Wouldn't the drivers get bored waiting for their turn to drive? we are becoming lazier by the time. Imagaine how much money the driverless cars will cost in the future. Most of of wouldn't even have the money to afford them. We will still buy them, why? Because everyone will have them and it will be the trend, we get carried away for what others get or do and we want to do the same. If technology failed and someone is injured, who is at fault the driver or the manufacture? We shouldn't trust in techonolgy, failure could happen. hese werer some reasons why I am againt the development of driverless cars.
