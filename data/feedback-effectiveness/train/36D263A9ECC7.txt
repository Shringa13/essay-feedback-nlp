What Would Our Country Yet The World Be Like With Driverless Cars ? Having Driverless Cars Would Have Both Positive And Negative Aspects . Driverless Cars Would Be Positive Aspects Due To The Fact That They Use Half The Feul Of Today's Taxis , They Offer Far More Flexibility Than A Bus Would , And Many Other Aspects . Driverless Cars Would Have Negative Aspects Do To The Fact That The Driverless Cars Can Not Navigate Work Zones Or Go Around Accidents Without A Driver .

My First Reason , That They Use Half The Feul Of Today's Taxis , Is Because Who Wants To Keep Causing Global Warming By The Gases That Come Out Of Your Car ? In Order To Even Have Driverless Cars We Have To Have An Earth To Keep Them On . Global Warming Is Basically Over Heating Our Earth And Is Caused By Many Things Including The Gases That Come From Cars . Using Half The Fuel Of Today's Cars For A Far More Better Transportation Sounds Pretty Good To Me .

My Second Reason , They Offer Far More Flexiblity Than A Bus , Is Because Buses Have Certain Routes And They Hold More Than One Person . I Assume That The Driverless Car Would Be A Mix Of A Bus And A Taxi Not Physically Though . Meaning It Would Pick You Up Wherever You Are Like A Bus And Taxi But It Would Drop You Off At An Exact Location Like A Taxi . Only Its A Far More Upadated Version Meaning Its Takes Half The gass We Use Not & Can Do & Go More Places Then Buses .

But Driverless Cars Have Some Negative Aspects As Well . One reason That They Are Negative Is Because They Cant Navigate Work Zones Without A Driver. So If Your Riding In A Driverless Car It Doesnt Know Where Work Sites Would Be Causing Traffic Jams And Maybe Even Crashes . Everyone Wants To Know Whether Their Drive Home Will Be Safe Or Not . Because There Is No Way For You To Inform A Driverless Car That Work Zones Are Ahead If They Dont Have A Driver .

Last But Not Least A Driverless Car Is Not Able To Go Around Accidents Without A Driver . This Means That The Driverless Car Would Either Do Three Things If Confronted By A Accident . It Would Either Cause A Big Traffic Jam , Cause Another Accident , Or Even Cause Angry Citizens . Everyone Knows An Angry Citize Is Not A Nice Citizen. Then If There Is Already A Traffic Jam Due To The First Accident And A Driverless Care Cant Get Around It , That Would Cause A Huge Traffic Jam .

All In All Those Were My Reasons Why Driverless Cars Are Both Positive And Negative Aspectd . The Positive Aspects Would Be That It Uses Half The Feul Of Today's Taxis And It Offers far More Flexibility Than A Bus . The Negative Aspects Would Be That They Cant Go Around Work Zones Or Accidents Without A Driver .
