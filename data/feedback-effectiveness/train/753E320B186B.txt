In my opinion as a student: I don't agree at this type of method but the same time is good for students and teachers to learnd everyday, life is like a school we never stop learning something everyday and acquire new expirence and skills in our grammer. I should go neither everybody need their will to vote what they want to do or spend their summer break as they like.

like you see is their break and is not fair to obligate a student to do a project with out a vote to give them a choice to pick if they want to do it or not. Example; like the elections a President can't be a President with out votes, the country pick their own candidates and the citizens give the vote to the person they pick best for their country

Most likely everything have a vote in our community fuction nothing move with out a vote to people is fair to vote, that how it worksÂ
