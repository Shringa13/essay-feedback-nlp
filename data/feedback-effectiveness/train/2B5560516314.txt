The "Facial Action Conding System" would be a good technique for teachers to see if the students were paying attention during class, and if they were not how could they help him improve. Using this system would be beneficial for all in the class room because they will be aware of it and if something bad happens they can see the video tape.

The system of recognizion is based to describe your emotions on certain things like as, if someone is not feeling well or if they need help with their work. We as humans, have a different variety of emotions that we can easily detect just by looking at their face. Most people will have the same face reaction all day meaning, if someone has a angry face and someone ask him if everything is ok, his respond is yes, is that his emotions and feelings do not interacts with his face reaction. In the Mona Lisa smile you can see like a pervert smile but at the same time, an inoccent. Determining different emotions associated with the facial muslces can truly help teachers to ditermine basic and normal emotions but also to see mixed emotions. As the Author says, "The facial expressions for each emotion are universal.", this means that not everyone will demonstraste how they feel in the inside, which not all students will have the same reaction during school and classes.

In conclusion, the facial action of recognition is some how bad, because students can act different if they know that there is a digital system recording them all the time, and can be good for them to pay more attention in class.
