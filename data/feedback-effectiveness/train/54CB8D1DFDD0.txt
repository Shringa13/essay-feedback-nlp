that we should change the election by popular vote for the president of the united states. The reason why its better to change the vote because it is easier to vote for the president. Back then the the people didn't get treated equal it was the seperate race and that it was by state law. That during the electoral collegeit was unfair to other people but that did change when they change by voteing the president. In 2012 the people voted for obama it was 61.7 of the people who voted for the president and they compared it to rommey votes it was 51.3 that voted for him. its better to vote during the electoral college because the votes is mostly by gae 18 and above to vote.

the electoral college it stores some of the weight in the political balance in that large state. In electoral college is the method of selecting the president my turn off potential voters for the candidate who has no hpe of carrying their state-democrats in Texas. back in 1960 segregationists in louisana legislature nearly secceeded in replacing the democratic electors. The most worrying is the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote. if the vote is a tie they move it would be thrown to the huse of representatives where the state delegations vote on the president.

when the president give thrie speech it helps them so see what they have done and the people have voted is it much easier to see how they be able to see who is going to be the next president. that they said electoral college is unfair,outdated,and irrational.
