Dear senator The Electoral College process should be changed. this is the rule of it process consists of the selection of the selection of the electors the meetion of the elecctors where they vote for president and vice president and the counting of the electoral votes by congress. I personally thinck that that is not that smart of a rule,because the president would propally say that he would do all of this stuff saying that we do not have to pay taxes and stuff trying to convince us to vote for him by lying to us.

As well as other presidents could be telling the truth and saying all of this stuff saying that one day they will make people stop paying taxes and poeople right away will thinck ohhh yess no taxes lets vote for this guy wile really they can do that but they will rise the prices on everything and then people will get mad agian.

I thinck that the president should not talk to everyone one by one because then that would be just way to long and tireing. As well as the person could just decide to bribe everyone. thoes are all just one reason that i thinck we should change the rule. There are also some good parts about it everyone will be able to hear the president talk instead of having to hear him through tv and people making adiou changes or people hearing their tv wrong or people haveing their tv volume to low

''And that is all i have to say about that".
