Earth as we know it has been striving for many years but our population is growing rapidly due to everyone havng children and deaths. We can only do so much one day this planet we call earth will be like the rest of the planets. Not being able to live on because of bad conditions. Nasa has been doing other approaches to studying venus. they tried to send a couple space crafts to venus but the rough and cloudy planet made the spacecrafts fail due to the enviroment. Nasa has been doing test to figure out something that can stand the venus enviroment. They haven't sent a spacecraft to venus in three decades. ''The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familir features such as valleys, mountains and craters.'' Venus is the nearest option for us. Venus was probably covered largely with oceans so it probaly could support human life but we still have to take the risks. how would we live on a planet that doesnt even have what we need to survive. A thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide blankets Venus. would we be wearing suits around all day the averge temperture on venus is roughly 800 degress fahrenheit, we dont get past 105 degress fahrenheit. Yes the planet sounds to good to be true but if that is what we have that is atleast like earth we should give it a try. considering the fact of life on another planet is fascinating. We can make the trip to venus but you cant even see it you will by flying over dense clouds and if you go under the clouds it's very hot. In conclusion Venus is like earths sister and if we can find a way to make it liveable to humans we should try it.
