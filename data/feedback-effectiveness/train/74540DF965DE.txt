Driverless cars seem like a great idea. They would use less gas, not pollute the world as much, and many more reasons. There are also many negative things about them. They are dangerous, not reliable, and expensive.

Driverless cars sounds dangerous in general. The best way to insure safety is to have an actual person behind the wheel. Even if the car is not fully driverless, the driver could fall asleep or be distracted when the car is notifying them to take control. Even if the number one rule for the driver is to stay alert and to be ready to drive at all times, we are human and we are going to get distracted.

Another thing negative about driverless cars is that they are not fully reliable. Any technology we have is not 100% reliable. The system can break down in the middle of the road, and someone could die. We should not risk our safety or our lives on a machine that is not fully safe. Yes, the cars we have today are not fully reliable either, but they are safer than a machine in complete control.

Lastly, driverless cars seem really expnsive. In order for them to work they have to build all new roads to ensure the safety of pedestrians, drivers, and passangers. They also have to pay for all of the research that goes into building a working driverless car. All of the money spent on these cars could be used to pay off the trillion dollar debt the United States is currently in, or it could be used to help the homeless get back up on their feet and get a home again. There are plenty of things we could use the money for.

In conclusion, driverless cars seem like a waste of money and time. We have working cars that have been working fine for years. So why waste money on cars that are dangerous, not reliable, and expensive?
