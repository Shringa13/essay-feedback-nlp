Now we have so many school was used the computer ''teacher'' to teach the students. It was pretty cool to see, now in the world we already have this kind new technology. But is we can make sure the computer ''teacher'' they can same with humen teacher, or even they can better than human teacher? Is the computer can like the human to read students' emotional? I think the answer will be: yes, the computer they can read students' emotional.

People usully have six basic emotions- happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness. So for this six basic emotions, people awasy can look the others face to read they are emotion. But is the we can make sure we read was all right? People make the emotions was used face muscles made. Yes, if a person don't want show they realy emotion to peolpe, they can make a emotions by theyslve. So when they do that, is we can still just look they're face to read they are realy emotion? That will be very hard, and was very eazy to read wrong emotion.

People was eazy to read wrong emotional, so what about the new technology the ''Facial Action Coding System''. The Facial Action Coding System can help the computers teacher to identify human emotions. They have all 44 major muscles in the computer 3-D model, and when they move the muscles was like human muscles. So they are can just like human to read human emotional. And maybe they will better than human. They read the emotional like doing the math homework. They will check all you muscles to read you emotional, even you try to make a not really emotional. Because the face muscles was do not lie.

So the computer teacher, will better than human teacher to read the students' emotions. They can find out students emotions and do right things to help the students. The new technology the Facial Action Coding System was very useful and they can more help the teacher find out students emotions.
