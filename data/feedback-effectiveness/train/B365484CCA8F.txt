m-beleve or not belive e- some people tend to base things on opinions instead of real facts like how people might say ' well how can you be so sure that aliens didn't make the face ' my rebundal would be 'the image first apperared on jpl website revealing ... a natural landform there was no landform . there was no alien monument after all.

l- i can connect this by simply looking at the picture and back couple years and to now how scientist reported no life for is on mars you will be boiled to death because it's also no oxygen so how can an alien create a face when no life form have been found yet.

con- in concluision i want to to say dont always go with assuptions they never always go the way you planned and also dont belive a tall tell ask the person if they have real science based facts if they check out then believe or not belive.
