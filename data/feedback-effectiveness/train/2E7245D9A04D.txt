The technology that they are starting to use to see people different emotion can help lots of people out when they think they don't have emotions. The software would be great for people when what to know the percents of there emotion and what they show every day. Computers show be allowed to read the emotions of the student in from of them so that maybe the computer can help.

An example of why they should be allowed is because the computer just doesnt scan just a few it scans all 44 muscles in your face. It allows the computer to maybe bring something up to you to realise that maybe this is something that i need to look into for maybe fun or help. Its helps the students outs when they are trying to figure out what they can do to help with each emotion you have.

Another reason why computer show be allowed to scan emotions is because the software can identify mix emotion. Its said by Dr. Huang," The facial expression for each emotion is universal even though individual often show vary degree of expression." The software uses video imagery, the emtion-recognition software track there facial movement in a real face or a painted face.

Therefore computer should be used to scan students emotions just so maybe is its really bad the school can do something for that student and get them the help they need. This would be alot helpful if computer could help or tell the school whats students emotions actaul are and what the percents is.
