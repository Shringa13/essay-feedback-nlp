Would students benefit from being able to attend classes from home?

yes and no; yes, because students who are taking online classes or taking classes at home would be more focused, since there's no distraction like other students or teachers. No, because it is not very active socially and physically, unlike going to school, interacting with people, and playing sports.

Also, if the internet's not working then the student would have to skip the class because internet is what loads the videos and is used for face timing with the students. Some students can't learn just by watching a video or taking an online class, they have to actually experience the situation to understand. But the majority of the students can learn from videos and online classes.

Since technology is growing, I think in the upcoming future there will be just online classes that you can take and schools will be there but the students will go there only if the internetÂ is down or any other internet problems, that way the students won't miss a single day of class.
