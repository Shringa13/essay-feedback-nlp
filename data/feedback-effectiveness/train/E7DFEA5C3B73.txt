I'm against driveless development beccuse when it's snowing outside and you have to walk to school with no buses. mom and dad has to work,live a mile away. Or when your a senior in high school what's the point of doing drivers ed to drive. What if you get a job you far from there how are you going to get to work everyday on time so you want lose your job. If your grandma have to go to the doctor to old to ride the bus hows going to take her for life support. Some one in your family is having a baby and you call 911 they don't get there in time and you don't know how to deliver a baby the what.

Anyone have a stroke in your family 911 doesn't t come in time chance the person dies cause you didn't have a car to save him or her. People need cars for important thing in life with out cars the whole world will be walking there whole life. If you don't like to ride plans,trains,or riding a crowed bus for hours or days you use a car navigaion has short cuts to get there faster. If there wasn't for cars there will be no intertament in the world.
