Phones & Driving .

Technology has made a big impact on the world today. The number problem with technology is CELL PHONES! We use cell phones all day and night. There have been so many accidents and mostly the cost of texting and driving. I think that drivers should not be able to use their phones while driving but only if emergency & navigation. This will lead to lower accidents in the u. s.

We all want to be on are phones every minute and every second but here are some facts that will make you think twice before picking up the phone. Approximately 600,000 drivers are attempting to use their phones while behind the wheel of an automobile. There are nearly 390,000 injuries occur each year from accidents while texting and driving. The reason its it so high because people are convinced that texting and driving isn't dangerous, we need us humans to realize that lives matter so we need to reflect on risks.

On the day of July 1, 2018 a new law saying that " Drivers cannot have a phone in their HAND or touching any part of their body while talking on their phone while driving". Meaning you will get a ticket and i'm pretty sure that nobody wants to get a 150-250 dollar ticket for doing something stupid. It's really sad when you think about it, people have developed skills and strategies to make it look like they're not on the phone.

People often feel like they will miss something and separated from the world when they aren't on their phone. So many many lives have been taken just because a single text or a single call. Thousands are dying and being injured. So no cell phones shouldn't be able to be used while driving.
