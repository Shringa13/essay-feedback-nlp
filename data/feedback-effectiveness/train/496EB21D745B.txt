If I were a scientist at NASA I will not believed alien because most of scientists said aliens are not real and I think they just made up of alien. A face on Mars is maybe when the wind blow the dust it trun that face or when they goes there they died and their dead body face is still there. But it's really interesting because that face is really big and it image 3 times bigger than th epixel size. But I believed there are not alien in the other planets or in earth because alien are not real but I have to makesure that I have to ask more question to the smartest scientist and ask about how did that face happen and how are we gonna prove about that. I have to ask more question about that too and they said that face look like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian style pyrmaids or even small shacks, you could see what they were. Some of them don't believe it because they don't see it and they just guess that answer. But when I looked at the picture I think I saw that crown and their face look shiney and in 2001 that face look destroy . I don't believe in aliens but if there was some aliens in that planet they might made that face too and they hid away from that face. I wish I see that picture for real and take some picture and prove it.
