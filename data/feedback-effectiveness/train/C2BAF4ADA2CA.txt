I am in favor of changing to election by popular vote for the election of the president of the United States. Over sixty percent of voters prefer a direct election to the kind we have now. I believe this change would make electing a president much more simple. At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters. This is because of the winner-take-all system in each state. The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational.

MostÂ  counterclaims to my explanation is swing states. This is because voters in toss-up states are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign, knowing that they are going to decide the outcome of the election. They are likely to be the most thoughtful voters, and the most thoughtful voters should be the ones to decide the election. Keeping electoral colleges would help in this case, so the candidates have to make both want to vote for them (Electoral College and toss-up states). Keeping Electoral Colleges also restores some of the weight in the politicaal balance that large states lose by virtue of the mal-apportionment of the senate decreed in the constitution.

In conclusion, I think the electoral college should be abolished. By doing this, we could avoid electoral ties, and the "disaster factor''. We can also be more fair and rational to voters. These are the reasons I would like abolish the Electoral college.
