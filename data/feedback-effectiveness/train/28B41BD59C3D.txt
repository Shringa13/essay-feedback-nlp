Explorering venus comes with a high pay off but high risk. The authors claim is correct becuase it has enough information ot back up the idea. Venus's geographical and atmospheric condtions would not be ideal but it would provide anthor option for colonization in the future. The exploration of Venus is worth while scientific endver.

The Authors study on Venus provides enought facts and evidnece to condiser further evaluation of the planet. "Long ago, venus was probaly coverd in large oceans and could have supported varouis forms of life, just like earth today". The planet has a surface temperature of 800 degrees farien height. Also the planet has a much higher atmospheric pressure at over 90 times greater than Earth.

Venus is closer to our plant than we thought. Even thought its atmosphere contains clouds that are made out of higly corrosive acid. "The surface has a rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountians, and craters". The terrian is showen to be ruff but not unbarable for human colonization. Also Venus is one the closest planets to own own planetthan most others. The due to the ground condtions being hostile surveyers would need to be located 30 or more miles above the surface of the planet.

Exploring Venus would a beinificail and woth while scientific endver. Over the years Venus has been a topic of study due to its earth like qualites. The temperature of Venus is not as freindly to humans as our own atmosphereVenus is one the closest planets to own planet than most others. Lastly, the exploration of venus can be the next ground breaking scientific discovery yet.
