In this article I would like to have the technology because a computer that can read all 44 major muscles, and also this is where FACS will come in (Facial Action Coding System.) It tells how a person it feeling, in my oppain I would want to know the emotions of my friend, I also would racomened this to the school consulers, only so the consuler can help that person with their emotional prabablem. Yes you can see how that person is "feeling by looking at their face,"

but some people can fake a smile to hide whats going on inside, some people are just scared to let their feeling out because they are worried someone it going to hurt them. The "funny things" about people is that laughing can be really contagest when you are down in the dirt, and your friend sees that you're just upset, they will do anything to mke you happy they will smile you, make a joke. just to see you smile . But sometimes just looking at someone does not always workout as some people would like. So this is way I would agree to have the technolgy to see his or hers emotions.
