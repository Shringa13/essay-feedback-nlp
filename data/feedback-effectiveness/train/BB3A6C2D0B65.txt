Dear, State Senator

I think we should keep the Electoral College. Even though it is despised method of choosing our nation leader, it is the best form of desiding who will run and the winner. The Electoral College is a process, not a place. The founding father established it in the Constitution as a compromise between elections ot the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens. The Electoral College process consists of the selection of the electors, the meeting for the electors wherer they vote for the President and the Vice President, and counting of the electoral votes by Congress.

I think that we should keep the Electoral College for five reasons. Number one,

Certainty of Outcome . Which is a dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College vote is possible but it's less likely than a dispute over the popular vote. Number two,

Everyone's president . Which is the Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal. Number three,

Swing States . The Swing States is a winner-takes-all method of awarding electoral votes incluces the canidates. Number four,

Big States . The Big States is the Electoral College restores some of the weight in the politcal balance that the large states (by population) lose by virtue of the mal-apportionment of the Senate decreed in the Constitution. Last but not least is number five,

Avoid Run-Off Elections . Avoiding Run-Off Elections is when the Electoral College avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast. The Elecoral College is not all that fair though because it is an anachronism, a non-democtratic method of selecting a president the ought to be overruled by declaring the candidate who receives the most popular votes the winner.

I think we should keep the Electoral College. Even though it is despised method of choosing our nation leader, it is the best form of desiding who will run and the winner. But it is the way our founding fathers made this nation and wanted it to stay that way because they created it that way.
