This face is not because of aliens it was just a landform. "Nevertheless on April 8, 2001-a cloudless summer day in Cydonia-Mars Global Sureyor drew close enough for a second look. "We had to roll the spacecraft 25 degress to center the Face in the field of view," said Garvin. "Malin's team captured an extraordinary photo using the camera's absolute maximum resolution." Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 merterd per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo."

Other reasons, "as a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than pixel size," he added. "So, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptain-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!"

More resins why, "What the picture actually shows is the Martain equivalent of a butte or mesa-landforms common around the American West. "It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho," says Garvin. "That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars." These are all reasons that this is no because of aliens but it is a landform.
