Dear, principal

I believe that the cell phone policy should be allowed in school but for school use only . The reason i think this is because, school is just a place to learn, everybody who goes to school learns at least something in school. I think that teachers are to mean these days, when teachers are mean to kids, the kids don't feel like they should do what the teacher has said. If teachers give students more freedom i think students will learn more better. Teachers should make a time period were we are allowed to use our cell phones. If there was a ten to twenty class of free time and we were allowed to use our cell phones, i think students wound think better and feel better that they don't have to keep there phones hidden all the time. When people get cough with there cell phones they get scared and most of the time dislike the teacher that took it. When the teacher takes it, students get scared that they will go through everything on there phone and tell there parents. When people take phones to school most of them are positive that they will get away with it. If we are allowed to bring them most people would be less worried and would think better.
