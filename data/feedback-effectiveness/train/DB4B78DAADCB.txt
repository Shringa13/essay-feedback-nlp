Dear Principal, I am writing you a letter saying about changing the school policy I think that students should participate in sports and activities students should at least have a B or C average in a sport. So that what ever sport they play they can still be in it. We can see what the students think about it to see if they would what the policy change or not they probably think if they liked it change or they don't liked it changed to have least have a B average to participate in sports or other activities. I think some of the students would liked the change and some of the others students probably like about the change of the policy that might be possible to change. I have no idea what they would think about the change to the policy that might be possible to be changing when you can only participate in sports or other activities like clubs and all the other stuff. My friend of mine told me she has a C average in one class and the rest she has like a B average she think she does. She also told me if it does change she would say she don't like the policy being changed. Because she said some students wont liked it any way. She bets some would at least like the idea of changed it to have least a B average. My other friends of mine don't want it to change. I agree with them about it possible about it being changed. That's all I got to write. Sincerely, STUDENT_NAME, P.S. I think some people would like the change so that way they can get better grades so they can also go to the next grade that way they can go to college and live their dr
