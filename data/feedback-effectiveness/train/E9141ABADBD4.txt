Do your parents or friends ever say that you should come to them when you want to talk or need advice? Talking to multiple people such as family or friends can help you see a different point of view and encourage better choices. Receiving and seeking multiple opinions can assist in making better choices because opinions can help represent different point of views, show possible solutions to an issue, and an individual can become more knowledgeable from opinions from multiple people.

Understanding how other people view certain issues or topics is a part of daily life. When individuals voice their opinions, we listen and try to comprehend them and their views. Hearing opinions on a topic from a few people can help someone think through the options or choices they have. We must know how to respect and learn from the point of view of different people. Besides, it will help make you think through smarter choices.

It is natural to seek for advice or opinions from many people throughout life. People may ask for opinions from family or friends to solve an issue. Even so, a person might still require more opinions for confirmation or to seek a well thought solution. Such as, when a student messes up badly on a project, he or she will probably ask a teacher or friend for their opinion on what they should do to fix the mistake. But, the individual could end up asking his or her parents for their say on the matter. It comes to show that a person would most likely seek more opinions to make a good solution.

In daily life, we are always around adults that have been through many experiences and are very knowledgeable. Younger people, such as children and teenagers, are still constantly developing and most learn to grow on the good advice and opinions of others. Moreover, it isn't until an individual is twenty one years old that his or her brain is fully developed. Opinions from more than one adult can encourage a person's decision making process and can help someone become more knowledgeable as they grow older. Overtime, that knowledge will be used to make good choices. The information we receive from the opinions of others impact these choices.

To summarize, multiple opinions can show you the choices you have and you can make good decisions based on them. The knowledge and understanding you can gain from different views can benefit a persons decisions and can help him or her make the best choice. So when a parent or friend offers you an opinion or some advice, take up on that offer.
