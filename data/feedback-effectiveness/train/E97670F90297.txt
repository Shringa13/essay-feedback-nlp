So in the storu it talks about going to diffrenet places in our solar system so in the story it talks about how some plants can actually hold humans in it cuase it has the same things this planet has but not all of them. So they where talking about a planet in particular venus a planet right next to us we can have a spaceship go there. they talk about some of venus things like how hot it is the planet reaches 800 degrees.

Can we go to a diffrenet planet thats what nasa is trying to figure out can we go to a diffrenet planet like in mars venus jupitor all these planets so in this story it talks about how can we go figure out what can be suitable for a human so in this story it talks about how venus can be a good place they got some data in. They talk about some features that earth has like venus has valleys in mountains in craters in paragraph 4 it talks about some of the same features it has with earth. They are looking for more ways they can reserch they are thinking about sending some rovers to look around take pictures of the place in how they can actually go around in check out the planet but the way they been doing is taking pictures from a ship in actually actually looking from close thats what they been doing they still dont want to send people there cuase they dont want to take cuations of someone dying in the planet.

so can we actually go in look around in a diffrenet planet in then call it our home well we dont know yet we first need all the information we need to actually start go to a different place but the future well tell the story.
