To start this off it would be a great idea to study venus because it's some much different then earth. When looking at it from earth soemthimes it called Evening stars. Which is one of the brightest points of light in the night sky.

Venus is alot different but at the same time alot alike. Venus is like earths twin its closest planet to earth in desity and size. Sometimes we arent as close to venus as we can be to mar. Mars, Earth, and Venus go around the sun at differsnt speed even though they are close to one an another.

To conclude these two planets are very close but canbe very different. Earth has two planet that arent alike and different then it. Mars and venus, but these three can be really similar but very different in many ways. We have life here on Earth but mars and venus do not that we know of.
