Dear Principle,

I understand that some people in this world do not care about our community at all, but it is very important to at least try to change it. Requiring students to do community service will make keep our community a clean and safe environment. Therefore, I believe that community service should be required for students at school not everyday, but at least maybe twice a week.

By doing this, you and everyone else who participates in this should be rewarded, but at the same time take responsibility to keep on making this place better for everybody. Some students may help with tutoring other students who needs help with schoolwork or something along the lines of that. Other people go around picking trash up of the ground and putting it where it belongs and trying their best to keep our environment clean.

Today, we still have people going around throwing trash on the grounds. I myself, have experienced people putting trash on the grounds and leaving it there. It hurts me because everyday I look at how much work people put into making schools, office buildings, restaurants, and etc. I hope that you have learned a lot from this and go along with requiring students to do community service no matter what it is they are doing.

Sincerely, STUDENT_NAME
