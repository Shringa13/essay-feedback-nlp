Dear Principal,

Our community probably doesn't look as mush as perfect as you see it. There's a lot of people out there that throw trash around or don't cut the grass from abandoned buildings. I've been thinking that is maybe the time to step it up and get all the students to at least to an hour of community service.

You should probably require students to do community service. I mean, it's for the community to look better. I did that in sixth grade and I can do it my last year here too. It's not a really fun experience but I'm going to do it for other people to be thankful of me too.

We should probably start by a Saturday instead of being at home bored not getting you anywhere. Starting by groups seems like a good start I would enjoy that.

Another excellent time would be in the summer. It's practically when more people go out and go by our community. It will look really nice if we would do a little clean up to it. Please, get us students to that job. It doesn't take time away from me, I could see my friends another time.

Sincerely,
