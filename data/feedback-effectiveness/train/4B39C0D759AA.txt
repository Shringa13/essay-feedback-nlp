dear principal,

You should consider policy #1 because most kids use their cell phone no matter what the rule is.

The kids should deserve the right to use cell phones at school incase they forgot to tell their parents about a minimum day, or want to show their friend a new game that they got.

In free time there isn't anything to do anyways.

What could go wrong, I mean it's only at lunch and during free time.

What's there to be called free time if you can't do what you want to do.

the kids at school should choose what they want so i think that there should be a student vote, but if you want kids to whine and complain all day then by all means, choose option #2.

I think I speak for all kids when I say we want the right to have a phone.

I don't care what you do, but do what's right!!!
