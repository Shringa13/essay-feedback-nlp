eletoral college can be a very good thing cause it can mean also picking other electors. this can help us and our state alot. But it would depend on witch state we are located in.

Electoral Collge gives a chances for people in the Republican or Demicrat party to also vote. You would have to let your state elctors also have the chance to let them pick a canidate chance on who they would want as president. According to the

Office of the federal register they qoute "The Electoral Collge consists of 538 electors. A majority of 270 electoral votes is required to electoral votes is required to elect the president" (source 1). Each canidates electors are chosen threw witch partys they are in and are also chosen to give a chance to vote. I do think we should keep the Electoral college because it gives a chance for even electors to vote.

when we vote we are also voteing for electors to work with the presidents and help him make desions. Accoriding to bradford plumer he qoutes that " The single  best argument against the electoral colloge is what we might call the disatser factor" (source 2). Even though electors votes it can lead to more of an unoraginized distaster. it can mainly lead to a lot of confusion and miss counts. a lot of people do not like the fact of electors being one just like the presidnet of untied states. what a lot of people dont know when they vote they are also voteing for other electors.

A lot of americans do not trust the Electoral College because they feel its not right to also be chooseing electors at the same time. they feel it is unfair and not nesscary. They should have sepreate elections for electors.

Richard A. posner qoutes that "When you vote for a presidential canidate you're actaully voting for a slate of electors" (source 3). Alot of people do not like the sound of that because they think its kinda like a secret.
