I will have to say no because you can't use technology to see someone emotional. what if you try to see if someone is happy but it come up with an erorr on your computer. like ib the text said that some comupter can't do it. so i say why can't some comupter can do it.

so what i think is that technology can't tell show how we feel. how we feel can't be calculat by technology. in some people may say that it is not right to think that technology can so how we feel. sometime technology can like stop working what are we going to do now that it's not working know more. what i think is that this is not smart todo because what if technology chage what they are feeling like lying to them like that are really happy but it change to say that they are sad but they are not.

so tell me this what do you think we should do keep on leting technology teel us how we feel or go deep down in your heart in tell yourself how you really feel. but i don't thing that the people that say yes we should let technolgy tell us what we should feel. they are never goingto give up on leting technology tell them how they are going to feel.
