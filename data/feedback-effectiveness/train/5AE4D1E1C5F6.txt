I believe that the election for our president of the United States should be chosen by popular vote and not by some random people we don't know. If I wanted to have someone to be in charge of what goes on where I live I would want to have a say on who should be in charge. I think that if a popular vote wasn't the determining factor in whom won the election; then that person didn't really win the election.

in the election of 2012 Barack Obama received 61.7 percent of the electoral vote compared to only 51.3 percent of the popular votes cast for him and Mitt Romney. the amount of electoral votes should not determine which of the nominees will win the election i should be whomever receives the majority of popular votes. in the election of 2000 Al Gore received more individual votes than George W. Bush nationwide, but Bush won the election, he received 271 electoral vote compared to Gore's 266 electoral votes.

There are many people who travel to vote for our president and it would not be fair to them if their votes didn't really matter because someone else made the final decision. If our president isn't chosen by the citizens of the united states then the person that was chosen by unfair terms and bias choices isn't really the president of the united states; but is truly the president of the men and/or women in the electoral college who chose he or she.

The president should be chosen fairly by a just and unbiased vote cast by the people of the united states. Only then is it truly fair and right to the citizens of the United States to call that man or woman our president!       Â
