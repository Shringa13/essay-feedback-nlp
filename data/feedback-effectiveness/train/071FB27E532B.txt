Dear Principle TEACHER_NAME

I think that the school should participate in sports plus its not because of our grades that makes you so upset its because of our attitudes and how we act around teachers and staff specially officer baker i mean the man has been though to much already, so the way i see it we need to have something to do with our lives and how we spend it on campus even off campus we have to behave when we are around teachers. plus i think those 4 letter words every day is driving the students crazy, I'm sorry but I'm telling the truth. But if you don't want to hear it then that's ok with me and that walking on the green going to connections please give us a break that's why boys cut up all the time because you always say walk on the green it is making us cut up like that since Elementary school we didn't have to walk on the green but now we are in middle school we have to walk on the green, i mean come on TEACHER_NAME can you just at least give this school a break and don't you get me started on boys not pulling up there pants, as RELATIVE_NAME says on RELATIVE_NAME's big happy family pants on the ground got your pants on the ground looking like a fool with your pants on the ground can't turn around with the gold in your mouth RELATIVE_NAME remix what. But she is right boys do look like fools with there pants on the ground, they got that style from jail they need to leave that style where its at and start handling there business and have s future from STUDENT_NAME
