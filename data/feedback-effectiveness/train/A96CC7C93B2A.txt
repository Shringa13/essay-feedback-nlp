Having th advantage of source the population with no more cars is what i would have done. With more people driveing behind the wheel what would happen next if you step on that road to get across while a person is driving behind th wheel over 90 miles an hour. In the U.S. there are people dying of accidents drunk driveing traffic and so much more that you dont know of. How much more will suffer if a love one is dead lying there on the ground in front of your eyes in tears beacuse that person was killed by a non licesend driver.

Its rough trying too get scool in the morning know what will happen when that person is behind the wheel. A deer might jump in the way while it just got done eating its meal. Scary is what i will say it really is when you are in a situation like that once in your life.

People need tranportation in this world to get to places all around. From here to there traveling in AC while in the heat on a hot day or keeping warm with the heater on a icy but cold day. If i have a job i need a car to get there to work while I make a living to put food on the table for you and our family. Hard it is with and without a vehicle but people still made it through with or without a vehicle. In my life my parents need a vehicle to get to work on time and need it to get home from a hards day at work.

To others its a dumb but a smart or nosmart thing to do but my opion is in between its a hard thing to agree on. Cars a effecting our population with death of people and gas and fuel that is blowing out of the rough with expenses. Prices that is excending to others minds is that is becomeing higher thatn i can ever imagine it comes and goes like in a blink of an eye you would even think it was gone until somebody told you it was.
