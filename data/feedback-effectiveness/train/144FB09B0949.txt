In "The Challenge of Exploring Venus", the author supports the idea of studying Venus through research and data that has been collected thoughout the years.

The author made really good points about why we should study Venus despite the dangers that it may hold.

The author talked about why Venus is worth studying.

It is said in paragraph 4, that Venus, long ago, may have been earth-like.

It may have been covered in oceans and supported life.

This is defintely interesting to think about.

If it was like that long ago, why couldn't Venus be inhabitable for humans now?

On Venus, we would have enough solar power, and radiation levels wouldn't exceed Earth's.

I think it would be fascinating to study venus even with the dangers that it may present.

Overall, the author did a good job at persuading people to want to study Venus despite the challenges that may be faced.

There was a plentiful amount of interesting facts that the average person may have not knew.

After reading this article, I am not fascinated by Venus and what the future intails for us humans.
