Many students would want to come up with their own thoughts on a summer project to have the motivation to complete the project, make sure the topic they choose is interesting to them, and know exactly what their topic is about. I believe that for students to complete a summer project, that the students should be the designers of the projects. If teachers are to design the summer projects will the students be as involved? I think that if the projects are student-designed that they will be in involved and will have the courage to work on the projects they designed. Students today are going to be more encouraged to finished and get done something they came up with. For example students don't like when teachers choose their project topics, research paper topics or group partners, because they would rather choose themselves. Also students that know their topic are going to be more aware. Student-designed projects are coming from the students therefore, students are going to know all aspects and components. Not all students stay on track with projects however, if it's something they designed students can't say they were not aware of or "didn't know what to do". As well as choosing something interesting to grade age kids. Most commonly students do not interact or don't want to interact with subjects or topics that don't interest them. Keeping their attention will attract them to finish. Many topics would not satisfy all variety of students so in order to keep all students interested and willing to do a summer project, letting summer projects be student-designed is a brilliant idea.

However since students would be the designers and come up wih all the thoughts and ideas, teachers would need to revise their project thoughts and make sure all project topics are project efficient. Having students design and build onto their thoughts could save teachers from having to come up with ideas, help new ideas, and new flow from one another.
