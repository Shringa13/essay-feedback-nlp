There is a lot of young teenagers and also adults getting into car accidents. Its because of our cellular devices, texting while driving. Teens and adults spend most of their time on their cellular devices. They are either on social media or texting. Nobody gets on the phone anymore its all about texting now. It is very dangerous to text while driving because you are putting more attention on texting then the road, and they take their eyes off the road while they are driving, which increases the chance that the driver can lose control of the car, and could get into a car accident or worse die. Texting and driving are worse than drinking and driving. Also, it's illegal to text and drive but people still do it cause they don't think about the consequences or what could happen. Texting and driving is one thing you should not be doing cause a lot of things could happen and texting is not worth risking your life. When you can wait to text the person back or just get on the phone using Bluetooth to the car and talk, its better than risking your life or someone else.
