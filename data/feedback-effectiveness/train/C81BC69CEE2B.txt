Although many people think that the "Face on Mars" was created by aliens, I believe that it's just a landform. Before spotting this landform, NASA had no further information on alien's on Mars. Also, the camera that the team used was at its' maximum resolution, meaning that they wouldn't miss a thing. Lastly, the team could enlarge the picture three times bigger, so they could see things located on the ground.

Before the team at NASA spotted the "Face on Mars" they hadn't heard anything about there being a possibility of aliens on Mars. Therefore, I think It's highly doubtful that this could happen.

Although the first look that the team took was a little hazy, they went back with a higher quality camera, which they set at the maximum resolution. With this camera it would be very unlikely for them to missunderstand an alien creation as a landform.

Lastly, on top of having a high quality camera, the team could enlarge the picture up to three times bigger. This helped them so much that it allowed them to see things as close as the ground. After this, it was positive they couldn't miss a thing.

Considering that before the NASA team spotted the "Face on Mars" there was no further evidence of aliens living on Mars. Plus, with the extremly high quality camera that the team used, and the enlarging of the picture I believe that this is an extrodinary landform, alothough some prefer to assume differently.
