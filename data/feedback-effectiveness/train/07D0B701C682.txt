Have you ever sat in your room and looked at the ceiling for a while and you see a weird shape or face? If you haven't have you ever stared into space and seen a shape or face? Do you think of how it got there, from an alien, your imagination, or natural landform? My guess would be natural landform.

I am saying natural landform because alians aren't real, and if they were why would they create a human face. Maybe they were tryin to send a sign, if they were trying to send a sign why couldn't they have just come to earth and tell us what we need to know. What was the point of going to Mars no one lives on Mars we live on Earth.

The is a 50/50 chance that it could be your imagination, just like if you were staring out of space or looking up at the ceiling and see a random shape or face, that is your imagination, so it could be you imagination. But the scientist wasn't really focused on this "face" they just happened to look over an see it otherwise just like if it was your imagination you would be very focused on to something and happen to see it.

It is a natural landform because when Mars came about this "face" was made along with it no one else put it their it naturaly came along. You can believe that it was put their by an alien but by the evidence and how I proved it you might think that it natural landform.
