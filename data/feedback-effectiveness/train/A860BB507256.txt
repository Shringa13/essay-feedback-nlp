I believe that keeping the Electoral College is the best way to vote. I think it would help voters vote on their own. It would also decrease the rates for voting just a little bit. Some people might disagree with me because they think that election by popular vote for the president of the United States would pick the best president for thier country.

If I were old enough to vote I would want to pick the candidate who I thought would be able to lead my country in the right direction. But if the election is based on popular votes, I would feel as if my vote didnt matter. What if many people voted for one candidate but the popular vote selectes the other? Then people would feel like there is no need for voting. We should be able to pick our own president rather than having other people decide for us.

Not evreybody has the opportunity to vote. But some people do, they just dont want to. Other dont think that their vote matters. I think that the rate for voting will go down if we have to pick a president by a popular vote. Then people who have been voting will stop voting because they would feel like there is no need to. I would feel the same way.

Keeping the Electoral College would help get more voters. I believe it would increase the rates for voting. But it wont if there thinking about changing it to a popular vote. I mean I understand people might think its an easier way to vote but our voice and lives matter too. Voters should feel like voting is important.       Â
