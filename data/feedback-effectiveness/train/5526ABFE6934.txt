The U.S. has been using the Electoral College for a long time.  I believe it would be a good idea to keep it, I mean why would you change something that still works?  Now unless you want to make it a better process it should stay the way it is.  I dont think popular vote would get us a good president, people would pick the one who makes those promises that will only be good for a short time.  The U.S. needs a president who can asure us we wont have to worry about everybody losing there jobs soon or not being able to pay for gas because its up to $4.00 a gallon.

Its a very time managed process, its not like they take some names, write them on a piece of paper, mix them up in a hat, and grab the first one you feel.  How big of a mistake would that be? Electoral College even sounds like a well thought out idea, for one it has the word college in it and college is where you get a better education for your future.  When electing a President you want to know that you will have a good future with the president that is elected.  Just because the Electoral College is old doesnt mean it isnt a good process.

Consider that state legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors, and that those electors could always defy the will of the people.  Back in 1960, segregationists in the Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy. ( So that a popular vote for Kennedy would not have actuallt gone to Kennedy.)

Voting for the next President of the United States isn't something you would just want to rest in the hands of popular votes, you could end up with someone who doesnt even know what he is doing, or even desides he can't handle all of the responsibility of being the President.  I feel very strong about my thoughts on the subject and believe that the Electoral College is still the way to go.
