Mr. Senator, the United States should keep the Electoral College process. This process makes sure that there will be a winner. It also makes sure that a candidate doesn't have a regional appeal.

The Electoral College process is certain that there will be a winner. There are 538 electors.

A tie is possible just because 538 is an even number; most likely it will never happen. The big states get more electoral votes than the small states therefore if a presidential candidate gets the attention of most big states he has a higher chance of being elected. This process avoids run-off elections. There will be a certain winner.

The candidates have no regional appeal using this process. If a candidate has a regional appeal they are not likely to win. No region (South, North, etc.) has enough electoral votes to elect a president. For example Romney was in the South and the South has no incentive to campaign, so he gets no electoral votes.

Despite the Electoral College having some problems, if we get a new process it will possibly have more problems and will be more difficult to control.
