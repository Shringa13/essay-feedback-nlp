Have you ever needed advise but didn't know who to ask? You think about who to ask do you ask your uncle is it your grandpa teacher who? The answer is all of them it is much better to ask multiple peoples opinions than just one for multiple reasons. Keep reading because I'm going to explain them to you so that you can a better under standing of it.

The first reason is that you are you and not every one thinks the same way. By asking more people you will have a solution that works best for you. Remember that you don't have to take any one persons advise you can use the the advise given to you to form your own solution. Over all you get a more personalized response to your problems or question.

Another reason is that not every one has the experience and knowledge on your situation. Not everyone knows how to do it or what to do. If you ask your dad and he knows nothing about it you cant just give up. you have to ask multiple people someone will give an answer. However you cant stop there you need something that works for you and some body who might have more experience in that area of life and give something that works better for you.

Last but not least if you have a question and you ask more than person you are going to get a more valid response.

What do I mean I mean if the majority of people give one response it probably the correct answer. You dont to ask one person only to find out that they're wrong. I would also advise you to ask the person why they think what they think. asking more than one person will help you better stand the problem and by doing that we can narrow it down to give the most valid response.

Thats why its better to ask multiple people. You will have a valid and personalized response from people of all different backgrounds. So next time you need help finding a solution use this advise. If your sure that i'm right ask around they will tell you.
