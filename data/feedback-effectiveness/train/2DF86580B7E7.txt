Foremost, the electoral college is a process used for selecting a president through the popular vote of qualified respesenators. The electoral college was established by our founding fathers, and still benefits us today. Using trusted representatives and efficently casting the desired vote, the electoral college is the best method of selecting a president. The electoral college allows the country to be sure of an outcome, and no one region can elect a president on its own.

Electoral votes are cast by electors chosen to represent each state, these electors are "...trusted to vote for the party's nominee...", stated Richard Posner. This means that electors are trusted and qualified to efficiently represent the vote their state desires. The trust set upon electors is "rarely betrayed" Posner said. The last time an election was won by someone who didn't get the popular vote was in 2000, and this doesn't happen often. This is contrary to what was said by Bradford Plumer. Plumer stated "The American people should consider themselves lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century; the system allows for much worse."

The electoral college gives America certainty of an outcome, without a tie, or a run-off election. The ability to rest easy knowing there will be a clear winner is an ability given to America, by the system of electoral votes.  A tie occurance in an election is "Highly unlikely..." Posner said. Even though most states use a "Winner-take all" basis, ties and run-off elections are still extremely rare and unlikely.

Swing states- a debated and popular issue amog the electoral college. Swing states are often paid more attention and given more information than regular states. While being paid more attention, the swing states together are able to determine the election's outcome. Though small states don't get much attention, they still have a say in the election.
