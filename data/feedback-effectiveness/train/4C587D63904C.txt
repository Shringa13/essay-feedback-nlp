Phones and Driving

I think there pros and more cons in driving and using your Cell phone is unacceptable. But I'm in the side of not using your phone while driving. Because you're supposed to keep all your attention in driving and in the road all times. Texting and driving can kill in split seconds-just the amount of time it takes to send a quick text message. Cell phones cause many distractions, there are numerous amounts of risks while texting behind the wheel and it slows down your reaction time. Therefore its very dangerous using your phone and operating a vehicle be at the same time. Because anything can happen in any moment you can get in a harsh accident just by texting someone or just picking up or phone in general.

Cognitive distractors are anything that takes your mind off the road like engaging in a conversation via text or talking on the phone, or trying to operate your navigating system while route. And lastly, manual distractions which are any distractors causing you to take your hands off the wheel such as reaching for your phone to send that quick text.

If you are texting and driving it's not a good idea unless if it's something extremely important for an example like important call very important and you need to know what it is or an important text that is necessary to know. Simply because someone feels like they must respond to a text immediately is why many of the accidents occur and most of the time this lead to a vehicular accident that can result in death.

Teens to the ages 16 and 18 are using their phones and driving they are getting find by the police. The find cost about $500 to $800 just because they were texting and driving. Many people think they're not a problem with texting and driving I feel everyone has the responsibility to put the phone down and keep your eyes on the road and drive safely.
