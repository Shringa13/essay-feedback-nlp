Dear Principle,

I think you should let students do community they want to I know you care for the and our well being the students in the that are doing community is doing the right thing buy doing but the students that don't want to do it that's up to the not you may be the principle but you can't make people do things they don't want to do you don't have that power. You should let the students do it on free well that well make things much east for you are principle you have a lot of things you do. So don't put to much stuff on yourself . Because if all the students do community service they wont have a lot of time to stay for test that are coming up and some times the students have to skip class to water the plants for the community plant sale they have going in the city its a big thing now. Students wont have the time they have now as students any more if you let them do it and they have do community service when its the weekend when have a day without no one after you about some thing than you get a phone call its for community were you have see kids work when its your day off. You don't wont that to happen do you so you should let the students have to community thing go cause not a lot of people are going to anyway no students is going to give up there weekend for community service I love the community with all my heart and I to get but asking students is not the way you need to go way over that you should take this to the president of the U.S he can maybe take care of that little problem you have so that wont be a problem any more I hope so that is what I had to say to you.
