Well, me personally, i dont think its a good idea for a senator to change to that. I feel ike everyone should remain voting as usaul. If not this wouldnt feel like america anymore; America is all about freedom and the power of free speech....etc. This is what makes this country great; no dictator telling us what to do everyday. Without the power of voting this country would not feel the same. It wouldnt feel like america anymore.

Also, althoughs theres a lot of cons to this, really its just more worth it. It makes people feel impowered. Knowning that they're making an imoportant decision in life. It makes people feel free and glad that they live in america. Where you have a choice that yours and freedom at the palm of your hands. Plus, sometimes people have more different opinions than others on voting. You just cant count on some people that you dont know to choose for you.

The popular voting process doesnt seem bad at all but i dont think some people would enjoy that very much so.
