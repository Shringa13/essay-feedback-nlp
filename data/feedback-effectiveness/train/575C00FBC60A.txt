The passage talks about all the positive and negative things that would make Venus be good to study because of some of theories of it being Earth like . The study of life on Venus would have many hard obstacles to overcome and look deeper into. "

A thick layer of almost 97 percent of carbon dioxide blankets Venus." That would be the biggest problem to try and fix because humans who take in too much Carbon Dioxide could potentially die. "These conditions are far more extreme than anything humans encounter on earth." That whole sentence by it self sums up how much of a complication it would be to study Venus. Astronomers are fascinated by venus that they want to know if it was once a earth like plant long before. Everytime there are some good positives about the study of Venus there's always something negative following it. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration has a compelling idea for sending humans to study Venus. NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientist to float above the fray." This a positive input to how to discover some kind of basic of life. " However, peering at Venus from a ship orbiting or hovering safely far above the planet can provide only a limited insight on the ground conditions because most forms of light cannot penetrate the dense atmosphere,rendering standard forms of photography and videography ineffective." This is a barrier in research not being able to get full anwers is going to be hard to discover life. The study of Venus would make the scientist have to think harder and make more advance technology but they can do that until they get full answers on what they might come up on.
