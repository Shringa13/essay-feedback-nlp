First off i would like to tell you what a electoral college is. It is a process when a compromise between election of the president by a vote in congress and election of the president by a popular vote of qualified citizens. The founding fathers established it in the constitution.

The process consist of the selection of the electors where they vote for president and vice president, and the counting of the electoral votes by congress. The elctoral college consist of 538 electors. A majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the president.

Each canidate running for president in tour state has his or her own group of electors. The electors are chosen by the canidatespolitical party, but state laws vary on how the electors are selected and what their responsibilities are.

The presidential electon is held every four years on a tuesday after the first monday in november. We help choose our states electors when we vote for the president because wahen we vote for our canidates we are voting for our canidates electors.

We have to save the electoral college because we have to have 270 electoral votes to have a president. If we got ride of it there would be no president or we would have to come up with an idea related to the electoral college. Thats why we should keep the elctoral college.
