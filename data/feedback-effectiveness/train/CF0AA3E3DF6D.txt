My position on diverles cars is that im all for it. They seem like a very cool and interresting thing to have. Some cars can drive up to half a million miles without a crash. They also can alert people to take over when puing out of drive ways or dealing with traffic issues.

The diverles cars also give us time to do things. They give us time to do our makeup or call someone. If you did that before you whould get ina car crash. The car basicly detects everything in its way. The car whouldnt always be driving its self u whould need to come in once in awhile.

They have many companies who are making driverles cars. The companies beleive that its not the smart car .They belive the roads need to be smarter in general. The roads chould give the car signals from the front of the car. The car read positive and negitive polarity as messages in binary code .They thought the roads wernt going to work but they did.

Finally,they concluded that these smart cars chould work really wel for peole one day. The only thing is that u whould have to watch the road just to make sure everything is going okay. Without the idea of smart roads you whouldnt have smart cars .The cars basicly are smart cars because of the smart roads. The car has many senors in and outside oif the car to help it drive by its self. The car also lets you know if there are any problems or if it needs help.
