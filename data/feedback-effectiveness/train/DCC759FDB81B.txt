Dear principle,

The idea of enforcing community service on all students is a good idea. I believe that it is a good idea because everyone should be taking a part in making the world a better place. If you have all student do some sort of community service it will make slowly but surely make this town a better place.

The decision weather to enforce all student to do community service is a fabulous idea. Many of the student at our school already do community service, but by enforcing this is will push us kids to get involved. Not only will this benefit the student's it will benefit the people in town.

It is not like your asking to go out and do community service for ever. You are just asking student to get out and help out, which might be as simple as picking up garbage on the side of the highway, or volunteering at a nursing home. All of these are great ways to get involved. i think the idea of enforcing community service is a great idea.

Sincerely,
