In my opinion I believe that students should not do community service for a plethora of ways. One way i believe that students should not do community service is because they do stuff to help the community in there everyday activities. Students recycle paper and throw away trash. There are many people already doing community service. For a child it is like punishment to do community service because its taking time out of there own lives to pick up trash. Although some parts of community service is expectable. Maybe once a every two months the students could go to a community center and help the homeless, such as feed them and talk to them. But it should be in school time since a person only has one life to live, and they better make the best of it. It would be fun helping the community with your friends, but not alone. Both of the elementary children and my friends are right. It is for a good cause, but it does take time out of what we wish to do.
