Dear,

Senitors

I Write to you about the Electional Colleges because, i beleive that it is fair to change it to which ever runner has the most votes will become president. I understand that each candidate running for prsident has his or her own group of electors chosen by the political party but it depends if they chose their electors respondsibly

Electoral College consists of 538 electors , but a majority of 270 votes are required to elect the president. Voters don't vote for the president they would have to vote for a a slate of democratic electors pledged to that person and if that person won they would go to congress and that runner would get that amount of electoral votes.

But if a tie happens the electrol vote would go to the house of representatives where they would have to decide who the president will be and senates would decide who the Vice President would be.

But in all my oppionion should be that who ever has the most popular vote will vbe prsedent.

Thank You ,
