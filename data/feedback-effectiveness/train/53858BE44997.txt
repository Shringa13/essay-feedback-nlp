I reconsider that are principal should let us eight graders bring are cell phones to school and allow us to use them at all time except during class. I think if are principle allow us to use are phones all eight grader will probably appreciated what the principle will let us do . I think the reason why are principle wont let us use are phone is because there afraid that if someone phones get stolen or lost the school would have to be responsible for it or be in charge. Also a lot of teachers recommend us students not to use them during class or any were else, Because a lot of teachers have said that we shouldn't because if we were to use are cell phones a lot of people wouldn't be pay attention or follow direction or doing any class work like were suppose to be doing. Also i think because if we were to use our cell phones we would pay more attention to our phones then our work, and also it will be ringing and disturbing the class when most students wanna learn.
