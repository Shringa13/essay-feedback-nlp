What this story is about is a boy named Luke that helps get animals on and off of the ships that he is one this job is called "Seagoing Cowboys". Wha twould you think is hard about this story? not getting sea sick, not falling off the boat, or getting along with the other crew mates? the answer is trying to clean the stalls is my oppinion. All of these things are hard to do, but you can allways go on with life. You try to do the best that you can, but sometimes tou fail ,but you can also succied. His favorite thing to do is to care for animals and he does it in the same way he cares for people. his aunt had a farm and now his childhood farming is starting to pay off the only thing that he never practiced was trying not to get sea sick while he was crossing the Atlantic ocean. He thought that his job was the coolest thing in the world to be doing for his job because he has been doing this since childhood. After all the animals were gone they didn't know what to do. So they played beach games after the stalls were all clean. They played volleyball, baseball, table-tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and the other fun games that made time fly by like a rocket.
