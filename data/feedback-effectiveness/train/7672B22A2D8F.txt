Well, I think all the students from fifth grade and up should take on the responsibility of doing community service for their school.

I strongly feel that if you are in a good community that you've been in for a while, you should at least take your time and pay the community back somehow. For example, letting the children do recycling for their classrooms, or just staying after school for an hour and helping out with a sports team.

Students will at least take a day out of the week to participate.

If some of the students contemplate about doing their responsibility to the community, let them choose a day out of the week to go and volunteer.

For the other students that don't play any sports or do any other activities, they would have the advantage of volunteering more at the school.

In return to their participation, they could receive at least five extra points added to their lowest test grade of a class which they choose.

No candy or toys will be given, because we would want the children to learn that you can make a difference without getting in return.

With the five extra points, the students will volunteer, more because they wanted to. And the fact the cannot play with the five points, such as, the toys or candy.

I honestly think by doing community service, it will prepare the students for more and harder things ahead of time, or it might just even give them a good feeling inside themselves.

I know when I do my community service, I feel proud out myself for making the world a better place one step at a time. Whether it's doing recycling, or helping a younger child with studying. Each thing has its own benefit and purpose.
