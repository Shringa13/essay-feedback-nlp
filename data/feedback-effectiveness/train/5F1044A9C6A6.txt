DEAR Senator my name is luis and I think you should  change the election by popular vote for the presiden of the united states because then the people would choose who they like better and it would  easyer to vote . the reason why you shouldent agree with the electoral  college system  is that voters do not vote for the president .but for the slate of electors who in turn elect the president. so the electors can be anyone not holding public office. the state picks on the electors and sometimes state conventions and state partys central committe and the presidental candidates themselves. so  what i am saying is that if change to popular vote  it willshare the candidate share of the electoral college and invariably eceeds his share of the popular vote. there are five reasons for retaining the electoral college despite its lack of democratic pedigree and all are paractical reasons are not liberal or conservative reasons.
