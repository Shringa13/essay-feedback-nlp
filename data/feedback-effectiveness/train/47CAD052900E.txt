Extracurricular activities are great but do we need them? The principal deciding we must participate in at least one is not well thought upon. Us as students are not all the same and live very different life styles. I disagree with the principals actions because, there is no time, some families can not afford it, and most can not even get a way there!

I say there is no time because students have homework, jobs, or even take care of a family member. Teens do sports if they want to have fun. A percentage of teens do not enjoy sports. There are even the teens that want to do sports but can't because their parents are working all the time! I am one of those teens. Most parents are busy so it is not us teens being lazy.

Another reason I disagree is because a lotÂ of families have no money! By "no money" I don't mean the have none at all, I am saying that they need the extra money for food, gas, clothing, etc. Playing sports or being in a extracurricular activity costs money. That money can go to better Things. Having that little bit of extra money is what is keeping some families off the streets.

No money? No car! Along with having no money and no time, you have no way to get there! If a students parents can not pick them up they can't go. A lot of students are only children so they do not have an older sibling to pick them up. Even if students are old enough to drive it is very unlikely for them to have their own vehicle.

No time, no money and no way to get to your extracurricular activity means you would get kicked out of it. These are my reasons for disagreeing with the principal. If you can't or don't want to, you shouldn't have to.
