Using Facial Action Codying System (FACS) to read students emotions could be a good thing. It could allow teachers, staff, and other students to know how a students is feeling. If you know they are feeling sad, you could change something to make them feel happy. These things could make the student more willing to learn and be more excited about school.

If you were to recognize how someone was feeling, think about how much that could benefit you and the person feeling that way. If you were to notice a student feeling sad or lonely, you find out the problem and solve it. If a student was mad or upset, you could fix that too. This might create less violence in schools and higher school attendence rates. It could prevent fights and arguements between teachers and students. It could also prevent bullying. If a student is feeling sad, lonely, or depressed, teachers could recognize that and fix the problem before anything happened or got worse. This can also make school couselors better at their jobs and make their jobs easier. If couselor knew how you were feeling, they could get you the help you needed faster then when they had to figure out exactly how you were feeling.
