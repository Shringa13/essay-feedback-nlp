The President of the United States should be chosen by popular vote because the electoral college system is unfair. the electoral college system also has many things wrong with it besides being unfair.

The electoral system is unfair to voters because many voters can be confused about the elector rather than just voting for presidents directly. It is also unfair that presidential candidate themselves can be electors because not everyone chooses the side that they are supposed to chose. Also voters can't always control who the electors vote for either which also make this system very unfair. The fact that winner takes all is the system we use is very unfair to the voter because it doesn't really show true votes only overall votes.

Although voting for your candidates electors seems easy you can't always trust other people to do the things they are supposed to you can only trust yourself. When you vote for the President you should be directly voting for him or her not voting for an electoral slate. Candidates should try to win the vote of everyone no matter what not heavily campaign in some states and rarely campaign in others. This concludes why we should use popular vote.
