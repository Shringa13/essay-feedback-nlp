Dear Principal, with all do respect I want to tell you why you shouldn't require all students to perform community service. First of all I think its not necessary because some people are doing it already ,and the ones that are not they have a reason not to be doing it! I know it is something important for everybody to do ,but it is also important for you to understand that some people just don't have the time or just don't want to do it.

I have some friends that are too busy to be doing community service because they have jobs or are taking care of siblings. Please do not require us to do it there are many people that don't want to .Secondly I don't think many people do it, especially all the trouble makers .They are the kids who really don't want to do it ,and that means more meetings with you .Now I know you really don't want to deal with that ,so why bother do the requirement .
