Dear, Mr. Principal

I say that students should not be required to perform community service but make it like a extra credit thing to earn extra credits.

Also I think that community service is a good thing for our community and everyone who lives in our community, but we should not be required, because a lot of people would probably drop out of school if we were required to do community service.

But you could make a volunteer community clean up club for our school.

It can help senior citizens and young children and people with disabilities.

It also could clean up some community parks or playgrounds.

But mostly I would just stick on making a club for volunteers.

That's some of my reasons for not making community service a required activity to pass school.

Also there are a lot of students already in extra activities like band, or sports or both or even other, so that could be very bad for those students.

But sometimes it's good for them and our community, well its always good for our community.

Sincerely, your students
