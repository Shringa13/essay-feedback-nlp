Driverless Cars Are Coming

"I can drive with no hands!" I can just imagine my baby brother saying that in a couple decades. The future is just a little bit ahead, and driverless cars are going to be the biggest thing since the wheel and just a flash. Driverless cars would be a postive, efficent, and a improvment in the world, because there would be less accidents, a smoother and quicker navagating system, and could make America on top because of our technoglicial advances: such as a driverless car.

First off, how many car accidents happen every minute around the world? I bet a lot. And why are there so many car accidents? Problaby because there not many of smart driver being asisted while on the road in traffic. Just imagine if that could be prevented.

There would not be so many inccidents and accidents.

Secondly, there would be smoother and quick navagating through the cities. there would be so much traffic either. Everyone would be able to get to where they want to go without waiting in a long line on the highway for hours. And if its a smart cars driving people would get lost and stranded places as much. Having a driverless car could be more efficent for older people too. They would be able to go places their self with out riding the bus, and waiting and catching rides from other people.

Lastly, if America could make these driverless cars, we would be the top country of the world, having such advanced advantages against other countries.
