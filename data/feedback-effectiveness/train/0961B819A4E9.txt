I would agree to computers that can identify humans emotions would be pretty cool for our inverment. it would change our inverment becaus ealot of people can just go to a computer and if the happy or sad it would say. I think that it would be good, because the people that hate computer would probably end up liking it. It would give them something new to learn on. It can also recognize the subtle facial movements we humans use to express how we feel. Mr. Eckman has classified six basic emotions, and they are happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness. Your orbicularis oris (around your mouth) will tighten your lips to show anger. The same technology can make computer- animathed faces more expressive. Theory of Emotion, moving your facial muscles not only expresses emothins, but it also may help produce them. You can feel other peoples emotional. it may happen becasue they unconsciously imitate another person's facial expression. this is why i think it would be a good idea to make computers that can see how someone is feeling. If there sad,or mad.
