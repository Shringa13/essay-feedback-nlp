I support the developement of driverless/autonomous cars. Cars have been driven by human drivers so far and accidents are frequent and often violent. If we had autonomous cars, we could almost completely eliminate human error altogether. Autonomous cars would also be more efficient.

Driverless cars would replace they human driver, who can be sometimes angered by other drivers, distracted by passengers, or get easily lost in new places, with a more logic minded computer. An autonomous car would be safer than a human driven car because a computer program cannot be distracted by its passengers or get angry at someone's poor driving because a computer doesn't think emotionally, but rather logically, making the computer driver safer. Google has been test driving partial-autonomous cars in certain conditions for 7 years and has so far had no crashes.

Autonomous cars would not only be a safer alternative to human driving, but a more fuel eficient, and therefore, greener alternative. According to Google cofounder Sergey Brin, autonomous cars would be twice as fuel efficient as today's taxis and buses. With more fuel efficient cars, pollution due to carbon dioxide emmisions will drastically decrease. Fuel efficient cars also help the American economy because if cars are using half as much gasoline, then we only have to import half as much oil, which will save us money as a country.

Autonomous vehicles would save lives and money. With a computer at the wheel, cars could find the most efficient and safe route to almost any destination. Greenhouse gas emmisions would be reduced, therefore making our planet a better place to be.
