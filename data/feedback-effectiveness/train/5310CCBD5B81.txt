Venus is a planet in our Solar System, Venus gets often referred as the Earth's "Twin" due to the density, size and occasionally the closets in distance too. we will never realize or really understand the stuggles and experiments people have to go through just to visit Venus ." Each previous mission was unmanned, and for good reason, since no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours. Maybe this issue explains why not a single spaceship has touched down on Venus in more than three decades."

Its not any bodys fault that nothing good has come from Venus, Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray. Imagine also a blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 miles above the roiling Venusian landscape. Jet airplanes travel and fly over many storms. NASA is working on more apporaches to study Venus and learn more , the good and the bad. They have enormously powerful computers that works with mechanical ,pressure, heat and other forces.

"vehicle hovering over Venus would avoid the unfriendly ground conditions by staying up and out of their way." temperatures would still be toasty at around 170 degrees Fahrenheit so humans would feel nice and tostey but its also not easy conditions, but survivable for humans. The Challenges of Exploring Venus can be very scary but also very worth it.
