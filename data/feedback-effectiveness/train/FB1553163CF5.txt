Imagine visiting a planet like ours, maybe it was just like ours at a point where it could have living animals, water, and maybe even trees. Venus has the type of look because it the only plant that looks more like our planet the Earth.

First, on paragraph two of the article called " The Challenge of Exploring Venus" it says that "Venus is often reffered to as Earths twin, its the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size". This shows on how cool it would be too going into a planet that we havent been to and maybe it can be like ours, its a worthy try even though dangerous thing happen because we never know what we could find.

Also, because in paragraph 4 it states that "Venus can sometimes be our nearest option for a planetary visit" this shows on how close it is to Earth and its worth a try trying to go there.

Lastly,it would give out new oppurtunities to go into other planets, because "venus is the second planet from the sun" and this shows and how dangerous it could be, but if we make it we can see stuff like the sun and notice stuff we cant see thru a camera. also, it would give out more conficence of going into space and going into a diffirent planet.

In conclusion, People should go into Venus because it show on new opportunities and find new things we didnt know about.
