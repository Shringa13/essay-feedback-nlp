People often get stuck in serious situations, where they have to make important decisions. They usually get advice from more than one person. People may ask for advice from more than one person because, you can get more help finding the best outcome,and you get to look at at the situation from another point of view.

When you get advice from more than one person, you can find a great outcome in a much easier way. For example, " I facetime my best friend and my cousin and say, " I need help with finding something to wear to school tomorrow." My cousin says I should wear a skirt because it's cute and very trendy, but my best friend said I should wear my new overalls because, it's cold outside and and they could be the new 2020 trend.

I took my time to compare the outcome and then i made my decision. " When you want two different things you can ask others to help make the decision.

Another reason why it's good to get advice from more than one person is that you can look at the situation from another point of view. For example, two of my friends see why the choice you're making is right and my other friends can see why it's wrong. I think to myself about how the point of view is different and which one I think can have the best outcome. You'll realize the differences in the outcome and make the best decision.

As you can see, when you get advice from multiple people, you're going to get the best option.

Advice from other people can help you get through things that you can't get through alone. As the old saying says "Two heads are always better than one."
