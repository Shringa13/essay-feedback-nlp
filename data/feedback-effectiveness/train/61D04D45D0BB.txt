dear state senitor I humbaly suggest that you don't turn from electoral college cause there are many people who depend on that college as a electoral support.

You may think that we dont need the electoral college but we do need the college because we also vote there and ifÂ  we dont then we do other important stuff there.

so instead of making a extreme dicision like this then you should think about the people and not let a hasty decision have a disaster on this good state because we could have horable president or govenor so please think about what you do or it will end nicly or horrably desatrouse.

so inconclusion changing the college to a popular vote could be a bad thing to do and hope you make a good decision that will mend the wrong and premote the right and have a nice day and make a good decision.
