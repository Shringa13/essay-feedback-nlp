I agree with the principal because then there will be happy and healthy students. The students will be happy because they donÃÂ´t have to go home and be bored. But what if students donÃÂ´t like any of the activities. Then they can go and talk to the principal and see if they can add a new activity. But if not then they donÃÂ´t have to do it.

If we have to do a extracurricular activity. I would want to do sports any sport that i can play. But if that sport is boring or not fun to me then i will and talk to someone about it. But what time will this activity be going on after school, before school, during school. no one know what time this activity will be going on. This is something that we need to know so we can tell are parents or gardens.

I think it will be fun doing another activity. Doing a extra activity will be fun well for some people. Some students might not like to do this and some students might want to do this. But why does the principal think this is a good thing to do with use students. some might want to do that. But then we will have to pay and some students might not have the monny to do that. So then we will have to start doing fundraisers for the school so we will have monny for these things.

So ther for i agree with the principal.
