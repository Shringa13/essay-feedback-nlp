The author supports his idea by giving many examples towards the text. He provied enough support towards his idea. The idea of studying Venus is worthy despite the dangers. With the information provied we can determind that the author gave enough reasons. For example "These conditions are far more extreme than anything human encounter on Earth."(para.3.) What its trying to tell us is that Venus is a planet in which in life is nothing close to ours. The planet is buring hot due to the fact it's closer to the sun. Explaining that life in Venus isn't possible human.

Scientists take a big role, they are the ones that plan everything. The amount of time and effort placed into their work determines if we get to travel to Venus. For example "scientists seeking to conduct a through mission to understand Venus would need to get uo close and personal despit the risks."(para.6.) Getting up close and looking at the real thing there... standing in front of you, unsure on what to to do. Everything around you looking brand new, thats what the scientists want,, To be able to look at the Venus in person, the authour supports this claim by supporting deatil.

After reading the passage I am able to infer the main idea, which was the author supporting his idea of Venus is worthy pursuit despite the dangers. The infernace I was able to capture,"human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally imtimidating endeavors."(para.8.) This paragraph gives us the idea of us humans. We could be told one millions times not to do somehting, but at the of the day we all end uo doing it like it or not.
