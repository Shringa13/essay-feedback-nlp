After reading this controversial essay on Electoral College and how it affects other and our "American People" I feel personally a bit ashamed at our own country that we allow all this nonsense to have happened. In my opinion I would want too ban the choice of Electoral College, because first off we're looking way too deep into our system of voting, is it really necessary too compare our states number of votes with another's just to possibly get noticed? Why dont we take things into our own hands and not count on voting for some stranger to do the work for us.

In one of they many paragraphs I had read, it simply stated "The Electoral College is widely regarded as an anachronism, a non-democratic method of selecting a president that out to be (overruled)" that doesnt sound like everyone here in America is fully williing too agree to all of this, and I wouldn't blame them.Â  I don't understand why we cant just vote directly for the president ourselves! I mean after all, he is going too be our leader. I just would never put that type of a big decision in somebody else's hands who I don't even know at all, and especially if I know its not completely certain that whomever I had put my vote in for is at a 50/50 chance of winnning as it is.

If there is already an apparent list of five reasons all about retaining the Electoral College because of its democratic pedigree, just is another reason as too why I'm against this kind of voting system. With having the first reason listed as being "Certainty of Outcome" should really make the person reading that question themselves on if they're making a right decision or not. You would have too go through a lot of trouble and paperwork as it is whenever voting for someone, At least I would like too know that I'm not basically giving my one vote away for technically someone else to do it for me.
