Dear Principal of my school,

I am an 8th grade student at your school. I have heard that u have decided to ask students at our school to write a letter concerning if u think that we should worry about community service. I think that YES our school needs to do community services. Community service helps our environment. Also if u noticed the main word in community service is community. By doing community services you help your community by doing service, by making it better. Community service can mean a lot of things like picking up litter, helping people, doing work, tutoring people your also suppose to do everything that would in any way help it. Also by our school doing community service we could be well known around our state by taking these peaceful actions. We might even be on the news or newspaper. By doing this action we might get sponsors or people might donate money to because we worked so hard by helping it and taking care of it the community might give back. Also I think if we do this more people will want to come to our school to enroll or interview us. All I am saying to you is that in my opinion we should always help our environment healthy by doing this.

Sincerely,

A Student
