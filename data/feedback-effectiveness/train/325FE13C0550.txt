Can you imagine a computer guessing everyones emotions, and tell wether their sad, happy, confused, etc. Well a 3-D computer can model all 44 major muscles. Dr. Paul Echman the creater of FACS has classified six basic emotions happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness. using video imagery the computer can track these facial movements, the software can even recongnise mixed emotions. Inorder to identify all movements of one or more muscles is called an action unit. Using video imagery and recognising the facial movements the software can identify mixed emotions each expression is compared against a nuetral face. Every human can make the same face everyday, but you can probably tell when your friend is sad or happy just by looking at their face. While for somepeople its hard to tell when their friends feel happy, sad, confused etc. Dr. Huang got a picture of the Mona Lisa and made people look at it to tell if a computer can recognize your feelings. They also showed people a web ad that appears on a computer screen, If the person frowned the ad would change and when you smile a similar ad would appear. Dr. Huang predicts that a classroom computer will recognize when a staudent is becoming bored or confused.
