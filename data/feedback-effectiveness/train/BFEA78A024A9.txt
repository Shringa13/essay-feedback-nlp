Dear, To whom ever it may concern I here am writing this this letter to tell you guys about the Electoral College or changing to election by popular vote for the president of the United States. The Electoral college process consists of the selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for President and Vice President, and the counting of electorals votes by Congress. The Electoral College consists of 538 electors. A majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the President. Under the 23rd Amendmentof the Constitution, the District of Columbia is allocated 3 electors and treated like a state for purposesof the Electoral College.

Each candidate running for President in your state has his or her own group of Electors.I know the electors are generally chosen by the candidate's politicail party, but state law vary on how the electors are selected and what their responsibilities are .. Also the Presidential election is geld every four years on the Tuesday after the first Monday in November.

Sincerly, PROPER_NAME
