In paragraph 2 the author states that all the trips to the planet have been unmaned for a good reason the spacecraft didnt last longer than 3 hours thats why it dangerous and hard for us to study the planet. The planet woud be fun to study but almost imposible the temperatures are over 800 degrees fahrenheit that would be imposible for anything to survive on the planet that meaning humans. Venuses atmosphere is also way to dangerous for us to even breath in. The planet is so attracting to NASA because the planet is related in shape in form they belive it could have had oceans and could have supported some form of life. The earth is are closes planet and it know as earths twin. NASA claims that a trip to venus would be possible, hard but survivable. The problem is with the plantes surface being so hot that they would not be able to take samples of rock or gases so what would be the point. They are working on something that would make the spacecraftes last longer in these conditions so they could retrive samples. They have some projects in the works that have lasted 3 weeks in such conditions. the trip to venus with humans going could happen but i dont think it will anytime soon. It could be possible but we will have to wait to find out.
