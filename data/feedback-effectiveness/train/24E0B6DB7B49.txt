Dear TEACHER_NAME

I think that having the school do community service is a great idea!

It will help clean up our community and help bring the school close together.

This would be a good thing because if the school is close together then their wont be as many fights.

Even though some students in the school think it would be a terrible idea I don't agree with them because they might be lazy and don't care about how our town looks.

If we had school community service we could make Bensalem look like a better place to live.

It would also make our school look good too.

And if we had a good looking school then we would be noticed more and people would want their kids to come to our school district.

Another good reason to have community service is so we could help the less fortunate in the area and supply them with food, shelter, clothing, and Etc.

So if you want school community service you got my vote because it seems like a great idea!

And again even if some kids don't want to do it because its "stupid" or "a waste of my time" you don't have to make them do it only the kids that want to volunteer.

So TEACHER_NAME

I think you should make community service an option to the students because I think it seems like a fantastic idea.

Its a fantastic idea because it make the school look good as long with the community.
