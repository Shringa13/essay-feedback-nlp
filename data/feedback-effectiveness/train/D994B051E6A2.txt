To inform fellow citizens about advantages of limiting car usage you would have to tell them everything. Like how residents from Germany upscale community are suburban pioneers and they have given up their car's. Street parkng, driveways and home garages are generally forbidden in there district. Why is this forbidden? i just don't get it. Car owners buy there own space, for $40,000 along with there home. In Europe passenger cars are reponsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions and up to 50 percent in some car intensive areas in the United States.

In the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency is promoting car reduced. Many experts expect public transport serving suburbs to play a much larger role in a new federal. So fellow citizens should help them out with there limiting car usage. they sure have a lot going on. Like in the end of car culture. There expanses and suburban ideals had long been one of the world's prime car ciltures. But American's love affatr with its vehicles seems to be cooling. Its seens like they don't mind.

If i was a big huge fellow citizen i would help out with what there going throuh because i don't think this is right. For them to be having to pay so much more then what we have to pay is not cool. What would we do without car's we can't walk everywhere. That wouldnt be right. They say te day without cars is part of an improvement campaign that began in Bogota in the mid 1990s.

What about if it was raining how are we suppsoed to get to work or get food. we need a car to get to places. They say the rain hasn't stopped people from participating. But i think it has stopped them. Therefore we need are cars to get to where we need to be. Â
