The author supports the idea of studying Venus in a descriptive way.

Have you ever wanted to or at least have learned about the other planets in our solar system? Do you know what Venus is? In my opinion I believe that learning more about another planet like Venus is worth knowing about.

i believe this because he's giving us details about our focus, Venus. He explains that Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any other planet in the solar system even though the one planet being close to the sun is Mercury. This is something unique to say about Venus.

In conclusion, the author supports the idea of studying Venus despite the dangers of it because he's being descriptive about Venus and explains more details about it. For example; he says," Also notable, Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in the solar system." This is something interesting to learn about Venus and thats how well the author supports the idea of studying Venus.
