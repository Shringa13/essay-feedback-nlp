Dear, Senator

Hi, my name is Khalyl Silver. I'm fourthteen years old, living in a small town in Florida called Boynton Beach. I go to Boynton beach community high school and i'm a freshmen. The reason why i'm sending a letter to you is because on my writing test they were talking the electoral college. The question was should we keep the Electoral college or we should stick to voting for president. I'm with we should just stay voting for president. The reason i say that is because the Electoral college is that we should vote for the voters. But then they could be bad to choose. We all should have a say in voting. we shouldn't vote for the voters. We should vote for the president. As said in these passage i'm reading, it's says that (

under the Electoral college system vote not president, but for a slate of electors, who turn in elect the president.)

I think we should do both, but the question is should we do Electoral college or we should stick to voting. Well we should stick to voting.
