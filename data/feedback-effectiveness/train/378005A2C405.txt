My opinion on driverless cars is that it is a good development. It can drive for you while you are texting or something so that wouldn't be a problem or not. Also it will have cameras on you to see what is happening in the car as well as out of it. I think it will be more usefull while on long drives and what not.

It alerts you if there is a problem so even if you are distracted by a phone call or something you will be alerted. But i think there should be more tests done on the driverless car such as braking, accelerating, steering, and turn signals. It will have 3-D ssensors outside the car so just in case a animal runs in front of the car it will brake automatically which i think is a good feature.

Driverless cars will come either now or later so we should all accept it and consider it. People will not like the idea but they probably haven't tried it out either so they have no real argument as to why this is a bad idea. This is my opinion on driverless cars.
