I would agree with keeping the Electoral College because its a fair way to elect the president of the united states. The Electoral College consists of 538 electors the majority only 270 votes is required for the final dessision. Each candidate running for the president has his or her own group of electors but the state law varys how many are selected. The presidential election is held every four yearson the tuesday after the first monday of november.

The states are called districts for example the word state also refers to the disrict of Columbia. You can help choose your states electors when you vote forpresident. Even though your voting for your candidate your really voting for the candidates electors. Most states have a winner takes all system that awards all electors to the winning presidential candidate.

After the presidential election your govenor prepares a certificate of ascertainment listing all of your candidates who ran for president in your state. The Certificate of Ascertainment also declares the winning presidential candidate in your state at the meeting of the electors in December. Then the certificate is sent to the congressÂ  and the national records of the presidential election.
