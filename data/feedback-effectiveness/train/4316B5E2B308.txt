o my god. what is wrong with you? didn't you hear about the football team? no what? you have to have a grade b average to play. are you serious? i wouldn't joke about that. but don't you have a grade a average? yeah but the guys are really upset. there saying i worked hard to keep a grade c average. maby we should write a letter to the principal. yeah i already no what we an say. ok good i need some ideas. ok we could explain to him that a lot of us are have real trouble. like we don't understand. half of the team only is doing so good because of us needing a c average and i don't no if they can get the b average. so they would have to leave the team and go write back to getting worse grades agene. there parents were so proud of them and they were really starting to get there live back on track. now its all messed up. maby when i right this all down he will change his mind. i hope so. ok ill see you later.
