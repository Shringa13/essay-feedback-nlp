In this article the author is showing how the monilisa shows alot of emion and alot of expression. The first paragraph stated that she is 83 percent happy 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and two percent angry.

For the most part she is happy you can tell she is happy becaus ehshe is smilling in the picture. What you can not see is the other emtions such as disgust or fear or angry. So how can the author really say that she is all those things if she. although it could be a fake smile you never know. That is like everyday life a person could look happy but really be sad or mad about something you never really know how a person is feeling unless they personally tell you. Facial expression are a big part of our world. As the author states, "Even though indivulas often show varying degress of expression for example not smiling broadly."

What I stated in my paragraph befor was that you may tell somebody that your really close with you feelings but then be smiling or not showing any emtion at all. The author states it later in the article. He states " you can probalby tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face." Us as humans have a hard time showing emotion or descrinbing our emtions . Although this painting is meant to bring a smile to your face it shows how much technolgy plays a big part in this as well. You can change they way somebody looks in pictures very easily. In our world today the technolgy is so wonderful it can changes images with the click of a button.
