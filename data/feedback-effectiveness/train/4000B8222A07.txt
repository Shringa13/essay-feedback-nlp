Do you think cellphones should be used while driving? Using your phone is the top ten ways of accidents. I don't think you should use your cell phone while driving because it is very dangerous to you and other cars. You can look down for 10-15 seconds then look "BOOM" it's a crash. That should be one of the least ways you want to die even though it's not always your fault.

Using a cell phone is a big distraction, not only to you but to others to. Everyone has to pay attention to the road just like you will have to. It can cause you to swerve; stop on brakes to hard, not pay attention to your surroundings, and last but you least it will cause a wreck. You can put others in dangers from your use to the road.

Having 4 mirrors in total is the reason for a car, without mirrors you will be driving and have nothing to look forward to and also backwards. Looking forward is the way to go because if you keep looking at what's beside you and behind you will cause a lot of commotion in traffic. If that can cause commotion imagine what looking down at your cell phone can do and what trouble it can put you in.

Explaining all this to the police is a big mess when the situation can be resolved by just focusing on the road and what's in front of you. More importantly is your life and you staying alive. If you need your GPS to get somewhere its best you buy a phone holder to hold the phone up on your window or just buy a GPS from a nearby store.

In conclusion, stay off your phone! It's a trend now not only to you but to the whole world. It's impossible to do 2 things at one time while you control a steering wheel. You can take innocent lives fin a matter of seconds for a message or phone call that could have waited. If texting or being on the phone is more important just pull over.
