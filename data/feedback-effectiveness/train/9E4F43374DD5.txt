Do you think that school students should have at least participate in one or more extracurricular activity, agree or disagree. I think that students should participate in one or more school extracurricular activity. here are some of my reason on why i think that student should participate in a school activity.

I think that student should participate in a school activity because if you normally have noting do after school but just setting around waiting for something to happen, but if you were in any of the school sports you be wont be bored all the time anymore. school can make you meet new friends or get even better at the sport than you are now. sport can make you keep in good shape and good health.

school clubs are really fun to do because you get to some really big project and activity but it also depends on what clubs you chose. like for example theres the FFA club , the FCCLA , the confetti club those club are really fun to do. you get to make new friends too if you waned to and when your in high school if you wanted to, you could run for school present for your school and make some changes to your school.

after school activity like sport can school clubs can also be on your patent reared all out throw out high school and on to college and thats why i think that student should participate in one or more extracurricular activity.
