In The Challenge of Exploring Venus the pursuit despite the danger the author include that thar are almost 97 percent of carbon dioxide is on venus and the temperes average over 800 dergrees fahrenheit. NASA is telling us like how it not liveabul on venus. venus has the hottest suface temperature of any plantet in our solar system. NASA has been sening thing to Venus but the hostile conditions on the surface of venus is bad so NASA idea for sending thing to venus is having vehicl hovering 30 or so mile above the roiling landscape. having vehicl hovering over the landscape of venus.

The text also state even a vehicl will have so much time to hovering over venus because the light can't penetrate the dense atmosphere. More importantly resher can't take anything because it is dense atmosphere. Fot them to seeking any info thay would have to get up close and personal despite the risks. Having knowledge fo venus meney researcher are working on some simplifed electronice.

The National Aeronautis and space Administration have a idea for sending humans with haveing bad condush. At Venus temperatures would be around 170 degrees fahrenheit. Stat frome the text researchers are working on innvations that would alloe our mechines to last longer enought to contribute meningfully to our knowedge of Venus. NASA is working on other approaches to studying Venus.
