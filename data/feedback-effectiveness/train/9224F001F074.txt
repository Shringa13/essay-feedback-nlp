In "The Challenge of Exploring Venus," the author suggests that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. Studying Venus is a good idea and learn more about the Venus from other planet and Venus has a pretty good nickname and The National aeronautics and Space Administration has one particulary compelling idea for sending humans to study venus, Imagine a blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above the roiling Venusian landscape.

First, studying Venus might be dangerous but it good to learn more about other planets than alwys studying our panet and Venus sometimes called the "Evening Star," is one od the brighest points of light in the sky, making it simple for even an amateur strgazer to spot.

Second, Venus is the most closet to Earth in terms od density ans size, ans occasionally the closet distance too. Earth, Venus, and Mars, our other planetary neighbor, orbit the sun at different speeds. These difference in speed mean that sometimes we are closer to Mars and other times to Venus because Venus is sometimes right around the corner in space terms humans have sent numerous spacecraft to land on this cloud-draped world.

Third, Venus is a thick atmosphere of alomst 97 percent cabon dioxide blankets. Even more challenging are the clouds of ighly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere. On the planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet.

In Conclusion, their is alot of ways to study and some of them are not the same as someoe who wrote it and studying Venus or Mars are very good to study in other planet it because Venus and Mar are the closet planet in Earth. Striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value, not only becuase of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeovers.
