Dear state senator

I think having popular votes would be better 3 reason why I say this is because Electoral Colleges has selection of electors witch makings them vote for the President/Vice President. The second reason why i pick popular is because when it is Electoral Colleges voters vote not for president but for slate of electors and thats who picks the president. The last reason why we should vote by popular is because Electoral College is unfair.

To start off with why we should have popular votes is because Electoral Colleges process consists the selection of the electors and has a meeting with the electors where they vote for the President and Vice president. Electoral Collegeonly consists of 538 electors but majority of 270 is required to elect the President.

Another reson why i picked popular voting is because with popular votes the citizens are voting for who they want to be their President and who they want to be their Vice President but in Electoral College electors pick and vote for who they think would be the best President for instance if you lived in Texas and want to vote for John Kelly you would have to vote for slate 34 Democratic electors pledged to Kelly in Electoral College but in popular voting you could  vote for anyone you wanted to and not someone who pledged that person.

The third reason why popular voting would be better is because Electoral College was unfair, outdated, and irrational and had lack of democratic and is also a turn off potential voters for a candidate who has no hope of carrying their states like them knowingtheir votes will have no effect witch makes them pay less attention to Electoral College voting.

This is all the reason why the state senator should choose populae voting over Electoral College voting.
