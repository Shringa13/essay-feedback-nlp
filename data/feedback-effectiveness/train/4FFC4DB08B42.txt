I claim this technology because when it scans somebody face it can tell us the percentage of out facial expressions. For an example Mona Lisa demonstrates that is really surprising to bring a simlie to your face while the computer shows you based on much percentage of happiness you have right now. Another example is that the facial technology had a lot of different movements that can track your facial face movements. Because it all about the muscles in your facial face. They even indicate the difference between a genuine simlie and a force one. You can imagine a computer that knows when your happy or sad or angry or even fear. For example, if you simlie when a web ad is on your screen a very similar ad will pop up again. But if you frown, the next ad will be different. Based on how you act.

Having this new technology would be a better fit with the people because when is feeling down and the other person don't know on how they feel they always use the facial technology to show the percentages of how down they really are. But for some people they don't need that because we can tell others people facial expressions by just looking at them clearly, which it true. We already know that if someone is feeling happy,sad,angry,or fear.
