Students wouldn't benefit from online classes at home because they would lose focus easier, cheat on work, and lack social skills. My cousin did all these things on online school and failed at graduating school. He didn't get jobs that student that when to public school did.

First, students would lose focus easier. If students lose focus, they will fail their online classes. Online classes can make it easier for students to get distracted from their objects in their home. For example, my brother failed online school because he was distracted by the TV in the room. Online classes are a easier way foe students to lose their focus.

Second, students can cheat on work. While students are testing, they can use their phones and cheat. They can also use websites on their computer to cheat on work. For example, my friend cheated on class work and test because she didn't know the information that she needed to know. Therefore, students shouldn't take online classes.

Lastly, students would lack social skills. Students will lack the one on one with teachers for help. Since the online classes would lack the social skill, they want have skill to get a job. For example, my sister didn't get a job because she lack the social skill for the job. Some may disagree and say that online classes at home are more benefit for students.

In conclusion, students wouldn't benefit from online classes. Online classes make it easier for students be distracted. Students can cheat on test with phones. They will lack the social skill to get jobs.
