INTRODUCTION:

venus is a big planet, sometimes is called "evening star", is one of the brightest point of light in the night sky making it simple for even an amateur stargazer to spot. In our solar system, venus is the second planet from our sun.

BODY:

Venus is a secons planet with more similarity in our solar system, in terms of density an size and occasionally in distance. venus is a big planet for to go investigate. The atmosphere of almost 97% carbon dioxide blankets venus.

on the planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greather than waht we experience on our own planet. These conditions are far more extreme than anything humans encounter on Earth. Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solar system, even though Mercury is closer to our sun. NASA is working on other approaches to studying Venus, for example, some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of venus's surfaces and have lasted for three weeks i such conditions. Another project is use old technology called mechanical computers. Just imagine exposing a cellphone or tablet to acid or heat capable of melting tin.

ESSAY:

If you think is good if the NASA want search information about Venus, and end venus is a planet with more silmilarity to the Earth, i think is good but with the genocide atmosphere is so hard if we try live on Venus. maybe just how are the atmosphere or search life in other planets but for live on venus is a big problem.

just live one day or less, or the human body change or some people born different the others. these conditions are not for a human, the human be killed in seconds.

is a big challenge live is this planet, the temperatures are not for humans the clouds are acid and we don't know if this planet has other lifes.
