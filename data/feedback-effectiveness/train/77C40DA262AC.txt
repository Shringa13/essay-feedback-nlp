Cars in our society has been a benefical invention that we've had. Now that we are living in the 21st century people are worried about the negative effects that cars are contributting to. If we limit the use of cars it takes away stress from drivers, it reduces air pollution, and avoids many traffic jams we have on daily basis. Although, life can be hard without cars their are several other ways to get around without harming our enviornment. One option we should take into consideration is walking. A little excersise doesn't harm anyone so why is it that since we have cars no one really walks anymore. If the human population in 1812 walked so can we.

To add on, stress in one of the main things you get while driving. You're in constant fear of people crashing into you,running a red light,running out of gas in the middle of the highway/street. Thw whole concept of driving is stressful enough for me and I don't even drive yet. If we limit the use of cars in our community it reduces lot of unecassary stress. The first source talks about a German residency where cars aren't permitted and if you own a car you can choose to buy a space for it which costs $40,000. Vauban (German residency) is home to 5,500 residents and only a few on them own car. "In this approach, stores are placed a walk away, on a main street, rather than in malls along some distant highway." The thought of having one main street where everyone can access all they need is a genius idea becuase it basically forces people to walk and it reduces the use of cars which lowers stress. We shouldn't stress about cars becuase owning a car isn't a right, it's a privelage.

"On Monday motorists with even-numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22-euro fine ($31)." Source number two states that the reason why this did this Paris was because of intense smog.
