The electotral college doesnt work in my opinion. It has too many flaws such as you are voting for a state. Thanks to the electoral college the 2000 election was a disaster. The electoral college system is unfair in a way because if your from some where with a lot of points your going to win that state. And if you win lots of small states it doesnt matter because someone can win two big states and beat you. Obviously candidates arent going to spend a lot of time in a state they know they have no shot of winning.

In 2000 17 states didnt get to see any candidates, because the candidates didnt consider them big states.

On the off chance that those electors won the statewide election, they would go to congress and Kerry would get 34 electoral votes. Who are the electors in the first place? It dopends on the state. Sometimes state conventions, sometimes the states partys central comitee, sometimes the presidential candidates themselves. Can voters control whom their electors vote for? Not always. Do voters sometimes get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong candidate? Sometimes.
