Do you think students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home? Schools are offering distance learning as an option for students. I think they should offer it to students. Specially High School students. I have some reasons on why they should be able to.

Students would be able to focus more if their home. They would have a less chance of getting distracted by anyone. It would be easier for them to learn more and better their self at knowing more information than they would at school learning from a teachers pace. Being able to learn at your own pace would be great for students. They would learn the information better.

It would better their chances of graduating. More students would actually do their work. They would actually do way better doing it at home, because they wouldn't get detracted by anyone that's in the hallway or anyone that in their classroom. The classroom can be a huge distracted to students with everything going on it would be hard for them to get any work done for to even be able to learn everything their suppose to learn.

Giving students that option would benefit them a lot. You have to think about it. If students don't do their work at school it's because their either messing around playing or their not able to focus with others around them. So letting them get the option to learn at home would be great for them.

Some would say that they disagree with letting students be able to learn from home is a bad idea. You have to think about what's best for students. What would help them succeed in life. What would make them want to better their future.

They ask if we think students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home. I think they should give the students the opportunity to want to better their future by letting from learn from home. There is a lot of students that want to learn it's just sometimes hard for them. So they should allow them to do so and see how many would succeed and improve a lot more.
