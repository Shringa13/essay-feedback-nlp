I think you should keep the Electoral College because its a process that consist of the selection of the electors. It has 538 electors so it gives many people a chance to run. I really like the idea of that i want you to keep using this process. Each candidate thats running for president in your state has his or her own group of electors. You help choose your state's electors when you vote for president. Most states have a "winner-take-all". Maine and Nebraska have a variation of "proportional representation"

The popular vote doesnt work because when they did it they had one the popular vote but lost the presidency. The popular vote winner could again lose the presidency but the electoral college still has is defenders. The popular vote can let peopel pick who they want but the electoral college chooses people for you to select from that they know and have a feeling would do a good job and be a good president. People can vote all over the world not knowing what that person is thinking about doing to this world. For all we know he or she could be thinking about destroying us and making a whole knew other part of a different world .

The Electoral College is widely regareded as an anachronism. but each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vte for he party's nominee. certainty of outcome is like percentage . the winner takes all basically.
