In 1976, a Mars Global Surveyor snapped pictures of what is known as the "Face on Mars." It is a natural landformation and is visible becuase of the pictures shown, the internet, and the area the landform is located.

First, the pictures show the "face." In 1976, the pixels were 43m (meters) per pixel. In 2001, the pixels were only 1.56m per pixel. The quality is worse the bigger the pixels.

In 2001, the quality of the pixels were clear enough to show that the "face" was only a lanform. In the picture of 1976, it is visible that the picture is blurry. In the picture of 1998, the picture is less blurry, but still hard to see. In the 2001 picturer, the picture is very visible and well seen. At the bottom of the mesa, it is also visible to see the lanform has a rounded, smooth, almost non man-made surface that buried the landform into the planet side.

Next, the Internet, showed what the scientists and the picters showed. A landform.

In the text, it states that when the picture was taken in 1998, it was the cloudy time of theyear on the red planet.

Finally, where the "face" is located. The face is located in a region of the Red Planet called Cydonia.

In the article, it states that "The sensation was short lived. Scientists figured it was another Martian mesa, common enough around Cydonia, only this one had unusual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharoah." Although the NASA researchers have concluded the "face" to be a natural landform, many are not satisfied with it.

Many people claim that it was built by aliens, however, pictures do not lie.

In conclusion, the "Face on Mars" is really a mystery. Many think it is a natural landform while others think that it was built for a reason by aliens. The "Face on Mars" is a natural landformation becuase of the pictures presented, the Internet, and the location on the landform.
