I would go with policy number one because something might come up that day at school and the student might need to tell a parent what happened. I wouldn't let the students have the phones all day because that would effect their learning skills. They would become hooked to their phone and not listen to their teacher as much. But I would go ahead and have them use their phones through out the day when they are not in classes. Like say it started snowing really bad at school that day and your coach tells you at school that there will be no practice after school. You could call or text your parent ahead of time during school that there is no practice. So it would be more efficient for you and your parent both. Your parent could go home earlier without having to wait for you after practice. I just think that it is important to have your phone at least when your not in class.

But sometimes it isn't good to have phones at all in school. Like say someone at your school got shot or maybe something very bad happened to someone and your texting and calling your parents, grandparents, friends, and other people about what had happened. Well you and your whole school plus the people your texting and calling all the time. They block the phone station so you cant call the real important people like the hospital or police. That would be bad so the there are PROS and CONS about having phones at schools.
