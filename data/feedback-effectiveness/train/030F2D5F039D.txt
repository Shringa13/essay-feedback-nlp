Yes, the use of this technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable, so students can study and understand how the artist felt when he or she painted on the canvis. They could be happy, sad, surprise, angery, disgusted,and afraid. The FACS (Facial Action Coding System) is a good thing, because not only students can the device but middle age people can use the device too.

paragraph 1 said "She's 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry.";and how we know that? you may ask. The FACS "Dr. Huang relies on the work of psychologists, such as Dr. Paul Eckman, creator of FACS" witch was stated in paragrah 3; they said all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles and when moving of one or more muscles is called an action unit.

Paragraph 4 said "The facial expressions for each emotion are universal" and that means every you move your expressions change. They also gave an example they said like not smiling as broadly. They can move and mix emotions in da vinci's masterpiece witch the Mona Lisa useing the FACS. Dr. Huang's new computer software cantanes similar anatomical information as electronic code.

So lets say you was trying to see all of your mom's emotions in one picture, by useing FACS you can move rotate and mix emotions to figer out your mom emotions, and to have students and teacher do that thats cool. So yes, its valuable.
