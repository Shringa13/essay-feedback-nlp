Disagree, There are many reasons that we many not be able to go and do extracurricular activities we could not have the time and they should respect that because we have lives to and so do our parent which is another reason. Our parents may have to go to work and the only time they can pick us up is at the end of the school day or our family can only pick us up at that time. another reason is medical problems or other forms of illness. A big reason is religions we could only be able to do specific thing. may we are not be able to stay so long but a lot of religions have to go to some form of temple or church to pray at a specific time.

There are some people who just dont like do extracurricular activities and have problems doing them. a lot of people need extra help with other things and making extracurricular activities mandatory is a real big struggle for them and just makes school harder. there are plenty of people dont want to, cant or struggle with them and that's not fair to make them mandatory. Why make things harder for a big group of people just so they will do extracurricular activities. there are students who like them so make them optional.

Their are ways to get around the struggle of making them mandatory by making them optional or asking our teachers if we are ready for them. We will probably do better knowing that we are being treated like an adult by giving us more freedom and more choices on there education. Why are you guys holding back on giving us educational freedom like the choice on if we do extracurricular activities. Why are you not giving us the choice on if we do extracurricular activities I can not tell you for shore but I think they dont trust the us to challenge our self to help our self to get better but I think we are capable and we want to and will If given the chance to.
