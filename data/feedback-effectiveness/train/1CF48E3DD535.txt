In "The Challenge of Exploring Venus," the author suggests that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents to humans that even get near the planet. Even with the dangers that are poised against those who would go near Venus, there is still intrigue in the planet from our simple human nature, the opporatunity of studing an Earth like planet besides our own, and the fact that Venus is so close to Earth.

The main reason of studying the planet Venus is capitalized by the article and the author in this quote "Often referred to as Earth's "twin," Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size, and occasionally the closest in distance too." The Author also simply puts in the article that humans have sent numerous spacecraft to land on Venus all unmanned.

Another reason for the intrigue in studing Venus is our simple human nature. In another quote by the author and in the article "Astronomers are fascinated by Venus beceause it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system." the author gives us a reason and it's a reason that makes logical sense. The landscape of Venus is also described in the article as Earth like.

The author suggested studying Venus would be a wirthy pursuit despite the dangers. I say they actually supported their idea thoroughly in the end. There also seems to be no error in the logic of the author either.
