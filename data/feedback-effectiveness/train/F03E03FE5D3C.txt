The technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is a wonderful idea in my opinion.

The computor for the students can be a interesting dissision for video imagery. The author explain"Using video imagery, the new emotion-recognition software tracks these facial movements-in a real face or in the painted face of Mona Lisa"(Makeing Mona Lisa Smile 4). It proves that the video imagery can be a interesting thing because the software can tract facial movement if it's real or not.

Anothor thing about the computor for the students can read the student's emotions. The author states" The Mona Lisa demonstration is really intended to bring a smile to your face, while it shows just how much this computor can do"(Makeing Mona Lisa Smile 6). It shows that the facial expressions can be read by a computor because the computor can know when you are feeling happy,sad,mad,etc.

The last thing about the computor for the students is that they can be a reowned drama coach. The artical saids" Constantin Stanislavsky, had his actors carefully reproduce smiling and frowning as a way of creating these emotions on stage. Empathy may happen because we unconsciously imitate another person's facial expressions"(Makeing Mona Lisa Smile 9).Therefore it explains that the computor can be a reowned drama coach because the computor is carfully produce of the emotions on stage.

In conclusion the computors reading emotions are a best idea in time and only time will tell if we can create artifitial intellegence to the computor for the best in the world.
