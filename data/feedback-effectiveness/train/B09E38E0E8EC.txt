Although limiting car usage may seem out of the ordinary, it has many benefits that appeal to people. By limiting car usage, people save money, the air isn't being poluted as much and there aren't as many traffic jams.

For starters, not having or using a vehicle is a huge money saver. For example, a German suburb, Freiburg, near French and Swiss borders allow the use of cars, but is somewhat strict. Rosenthal states, "Car ownership is allowed, but there are only two places to park-large garages at the edge of the development, where a car-owner buys a space, for $40,000, along with a home." Not only does it cost $40,000 just for that but gas and fix-ups go along with having a car.

Secondly, the less people use vehicles, the less air pollution is going to be created. For instance, Paris issued a driving ban in an effort to "clear the air of the global city." Duffer says, "Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after five-days of intensifying smog..." The smog that affects Paris is also known to "rival" with Bejing, China, one of the most polluted cities in the world. By banning car usage for a day, the air had a chance to breathe and is overall healthier for the people that live in that area.

Lastly, it's obvious to say that with less car usage, the more likely it is to have a decrease in number of traffic jams. To further explain, Bogota, Columbia has a program in which people do not use vehicles to get where they need to go. Andrew Selsky states, "...millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work during a car-free day.. leaving the streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams." It's a positive thing to have "car-free day" because less accidents mean less people getting injured.

To conclude, limiting car usage is not only good for people, but it can be positive toward the earth and environment as well because it saves people money, the air is healthier and people have less of a chance of crashing.
