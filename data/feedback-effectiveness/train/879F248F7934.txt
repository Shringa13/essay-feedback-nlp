Dear, State Senator

Hi, State Senator my name is PROPER_NAME and i think you should stay with Electoral College because the Electoral college is a process not a place. Stated in paragraph 1 it says " The founding fathers establsihed it in the constitution as a compromise between election of the president by a popular vote of qualifed citzens". So in my owns i think what was stated means it should be a tradition and it should stay as a tradition in the American culture. The Electoral College consists of 538 electors. A majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the president. With that being said that is just like saying you are choosing a president by the most popular votes. In paragraph ten it says under the electoral college system , voters vote not for the president but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president.To me in the passage the bset argument for you to keep the Electoral College is the electoral college is less work than having everyone vote and round it off for a president to be elected. But i'm not going to waste any of your time anymore just know Electoral College would be the best choice for you to choose
