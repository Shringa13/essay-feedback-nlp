Dear principle,

I do not think that every student should be forced to do community service. All community service is voluntary work, if its not voluntary, then it is just work. People who do community service enjoy and want to help the community, if they are forced to do community service, they would not perform to the best of their abilities and waste their time. This would not be best for the schools and the community.

The concept of community service is that you go do your work that you got and you do it for free because you wanted to and you feel good about yourself. Forcing a person to do this would take away all the positive effects except maybe getting the job done. Community service isn't always needed either. So having a very random schedule would be very hard for the students to keep up with.

This would cause stress to the students, teachers would have a hard time planning each day due to late notice help, and the community wouldn't get much help.
