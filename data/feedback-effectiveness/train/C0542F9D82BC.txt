Why seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice. Sometime going to other people for advice can help you with many different situations. Some people may have a very good explanation to whats going on,they just maybe more experienced then you, or can be seen for another point of view.

First sometime going to other people for advice can help you with many different situations. Your having a problem in yous relationship,and you want to work it out but you dont know whats going on. Maybe your not spending enoughÂ time with your husband or wife. So you go to a friend you can trust,and yall talk about what to do,then you go back home and work it out.

Second Some people may have a very good explanation to whats going on,or maybe they have more experience then you. Your've building a car with your dad and you try to start it but it wont turn on. You and your dad are lost on what to do. So you go to a mechanic,and turns out u was missing some key parts to the motor.

Third the person you go to see may look at the problem from a different point of view. Your arguing with a sibling about something and both of you think you right. Your sibling goes to your parents about the situation. Both of you tell your side of the argument. Your sibling is right,but you wasnt completely wrong either.

Finally in my opinion going to other people for advice is a great choice if your torn about what to do. Different people mean different results. The more people more results. This will conclude my essay thank you.
