dear senator:

the electoral college most be important that makes the people to chose what do they want it consists to make the people take their own desiton about who do they want to help them and make their lives better in al the ways, the electors have to be near the people of the town or city cause in that way the people feels more closer to them and they can trust the work of the electors.

the certificate of ascertainment declares that the winnig presidential elector in the state ans whows which elector will be represent the state at the meeting of the electors in december of the election year,that means that you help choose your state's electors when you vote for a president because when you voete for you candidate you are actually voting for your candidate's electors.

after a presidential election , the governor prepares a "certificates" of ascertainment"

your state are sent to the congress and the national archives as part of the official records of the presidental election.

on source 1 the author is trying to explain how does this works,to help the people of the town and especially that if you vote that means that you are helping to the elctors and that probaly wil not help if you dont choose the correct person.
