Why should you become a Seagoing Cowboy? Well first let me tell you about a boy named Luke who was a Seagoing Cowboy. A Seagoing Cowboy is on this boat with other Seagoing Cowboys. To go help Europe where World War II just ended.

They were heading over to Europe because, many countries over there were ruined. So they were coming over to bring them food supplies, animals, and more. If you love to help, this would be something for you that you would enjoy. Luke traveled through the Atlantic occean and pacific. Trying to help these countries that were left in ruins. When Luke was on the boat he had a job to do. He had to feed the animals and keep them healthy. He also had to clean the animals and keep there stalls clean.

When your a Seagoing Cowboy you have a big responsibility. You also have alot of jobs to take care of. Another job Luke had, was a night watchman. That job was to check on all the animals every hour. Then make his hourly report to the captain. A Seagoing Cowboy wasn't always working. When they unloaded the animals and were heading back there was an empty space. So sometimes the cowboys played games. Like baseball, volleyball, table-tennis, fincing, boxing, and more. Luke always enjoyed that part.

So this is what a Seagoing Cowboy is and what he does. If your someone who's willing to be on a boat for a long time and take care of animals and if you also love to help people. This job is perfect for you. While your on the boat you get to make new friends and explore unique places. It was just a big adevnture. Also if you love dealing with animals this is another good reason to become a Seagoing Cowboy. Take the information that I gave you. Luke loved being a Seagoing Cowboy and if you have the heart like Luke, this is the job for you.
