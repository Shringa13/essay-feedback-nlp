The passage "Drivless Cars are Coming" have negative and positives. I would say I am against dirivless cars. Why not use cars that we can drive ourselves? Are Drivless cars actually the safest? If you were to ask me those questions I would say we need to stay with the cars tan we can drive. I would also say driveless cars are not the safest.

If we continue to use the cars we use today we don't put our safety in a computer hands. I think we should stay accountable for our own safety and make our own decisions while driving. In the passage it states that in certain situation the car will alert the driver when he or she needs to take control. The thing about that is what if it doesn't alert the driver and the car keeps going and causes a car accident which can potentially kill people or put their lives in danger. Then it goes into a even bigger situation if the accident is on the driver or on the manufacturing company. It really could go either way but why even take the risk in putting your life in the hands of a computer.

What if a police car or the ambulance is coming and the car doesn't pull over to the side of the road to let them have a clear passage to get where they need to go? Now you can possibly go to jail, but wait is that on you or the manufacturing company. There will be a lot of sewing of company's and a lot of fights between the people of the driveless cars and company's. The thing is we the people have a chance to avoid all of this now if we just decide not to make or buy a driveless car. The question you have to ask yourself is will you put your safety in the hands of a driveless car or will you be accountable for your own saftey? It's your choice just make sure you make the right decision.
