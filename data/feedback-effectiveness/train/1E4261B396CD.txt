Venus is one of three planets that orbit the sun at different times and speeds. Venus has a temperature of 800 degrees ferenheit and the atmospheric pressure is about 90 greater than what we get on Earth. These are the reasons why Venus is worthy despite of all the dangers. From the text " The Challenge of Exploring Venus" states that " Solar power would be plentiful and radiation would not exceed Earth's leves. Not easy conditions, but survivable for humans" (Paragraph 5). So even with the high radiation levels humans can still survive on Venus. In the text it also states " Some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in the chamber simulating the chaos of Venus's surface and lasted for three weeks in such conditions" (paragraph 7). To summarize why studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite of how dangerous it is scientist have found and made devices that could help pick up and look for sediments on Venus due to hot it is when standing on it.
