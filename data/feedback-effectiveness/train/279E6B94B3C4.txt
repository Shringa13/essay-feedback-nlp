Texting and driving needs to stop now before more people get hurt. ADD is a big reason too for people have no choice but to get distracted on things which cause crashes.

Distraction is the main reason crashes happen, people get distracted on anything and everything and don't know what to do when they're about to crash. Phones are big distractions in the world today, especially in teens who just start driving, when they get a message the first thing they know to do is check it no matter what. To fix this problem states have inflicted heavier laws, for example Georgia has the no hands law and that means you can't have any hands on your phone at all, not even calls can be answered. Texting while driving is such a bad choice because it can cause you to swerve off road or swerve into someone's car. It's a bad habit in today's society and it needs to be stopped.

In conclusion texting and driving is all out bad, and needs to be stopped, there needs to be classes and more lessons taught on the effects of texting and driving. People need to also set an example for the new future because if it's not in forced more teens are liable to do it.
