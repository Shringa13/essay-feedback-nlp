Dear Principal,

I think community service should not be a requirement ,but strongly suggest it to the students. I think if you want to do it as a whole school put it in a field trip. If you're the principal of a public school you should go to a big public area and split the kids into groups. If you're the principal to a small private school with around one-hundred kids go to a public park.

I go to a small private school and we did it last year. I found it alright because I were with my friends and we were talking and making jokes the entire time. Plus we played on the playground when we were done. As strange as that sounds it was a ton of fun. And where we went was a small zoo so I got to look at animals too.

I remember when we walked there I was playing with my plastic bag and I popped it. I figured out how to fix it by tying it. It wasn't a big rip so I could tie a knot by it to close it up. I certainly had better field trips but it was alright. I hope you use this idea for your school. At a public school I'm not sure how well this will turn out.

For a public school you might have to make it a requirement. I think you should hand out sheets to the students and have them write down the hours they did and have the person who was in charge sign it. Oh yeah also have them have a requirement of at least ten hours a semester. I hope you have good luck with your task and choose which idea would work for your school. One more thing don't let the students who get in trouble a lot find goose eggs. Some of them won't make it. Trust me.
