In this aricle , the author its trying to you take you to Venus with all the danger. For explain, in paragaph 1 it say that "Venus is simple to see from distant but safe vanage point of earth, it has proves a very challenging place to examine more closely " its is ever challenging visting, trying to do go and rescreach on a plant where you dont know anything about it.

Venus is the twin of earth, right around the corner. In the pharagh 2, it say, "humans have sent numerous spacecraft to land on this cloud draped world." Every previous mission was unmanned. You may be asking yourself why , because no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours . They belived thats why not a single spaceship has touched down on Venus. Its a really challeng for plant for human to study.

One of the challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acis in Venus atmosphere. On planets surface, temperatures avarage over 800 degrees , and the atompheric average 800 degrees Fahrenheit. Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solar systems.

Let me tell you this , long ago Venus was probably covered largely with and COULD

have supported various froms of life, just like Earth.

Venus can be save to resreach but what person would want to do at ?

NOT EASY CONDITIONS , FOR HUMANS!
