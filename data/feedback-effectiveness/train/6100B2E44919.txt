My Claim About The Author Idea That Studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite it's more important because it's the closest planet next to Earth and it gets more attention then the other planets because it's closer to us humans I jus feel like that's the more important planet & it's value, but my explantion about my claim in this article. In the article it says Venus is referred to as Earth "twin" and it's the closet to Earth & the also call Venus the "Evening Star" its the brightest light in the night sky and a another fact I can say it's in between the Sun and The Earth and I think thats why it make it so special even though Mercury is Closer Too The Sun and in the text it says "Venus has the hottest surface temperture of any planet in the solar system and Venus haves features that are analogous to those on Earth so in my opinon Venus has almost alot of things to do with or deal with Earth.
