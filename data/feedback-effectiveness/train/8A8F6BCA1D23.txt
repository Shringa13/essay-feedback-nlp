Dear state senator,

In reference to our state we would prefer keeping the electoral college instead of abolishing it. Under the 23 Amendment of the constitution, the district of columbia is allocated three electors and treated like a state for pupose of the Electoral college. If you take this away, there will be anarchy all around us, and I assure you that you dont want this to happen.

The electoral college is a right for us, and it lets us know that we have a right, and a say in this country. It would be wrong to take that away from us.

What have Richard nixon, Jimmy carter, Bob dole, and the AFL-CIO all, in their own time, agreed on? They all agreed on abolishing the electoral college. And they are not the only one's who have said it. According to the gallup poll in 2000, shortly after Al Gore, thanks to the quirks of the electoral collge, won the popular vote but lost because of the 60% of his voters prefered a direct election to the kind we have now. This year voters can expect another close election in which the popular vote winner could again lose the presidency. And yet, the electoral college still has its defenders.

I urge you to please consider your peoples feelings on this matter and consider not abolishing the electoral college.

Sincerly, a concerned citizen.
