"When people ask for advice, they will most likely ask multiple people". The reason people seek for advice from multiple people is because seeking advice from one person is way too easy and by now some people have figured out that god laughs at us when we try something thats too easy and says, "Hahaha you really thought you could do that, thats to easy your gonna have to do more if you want to do that!" I'm getting off topic. The reason people ask more than one person for advice is because like I said its too easy so asking more than one person you can have different opinions but eventually you will get they same answer more often then you have what you should do, just don't ask old people or they will give you a story and it will be long and boring. There you go a essay telling you how asking for help from multiple people, can give you multiple opinions and which ever one you get you get more of the same answer and you us that one because it seemed to have worked on other people or there just lying to you and saying "finally that kids gone".

But as I was saying, ask multiple people for help, not just one. Asking one is just plain stupid, but asking multiple will give you multiple reasons why you should go with that answer. Think of it like this, if you ask multiple people for help with idk ask out your crush, most of them tell you to be casual and to not get nervous, so what are you going to choose, the one that you got most of the same answer.
