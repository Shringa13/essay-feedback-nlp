If we limit our car usage throughout the year we can cut the rate of carbon dioxiod we produce by 1/2! That will save uor trees, animals, and even our own lifes in the future. Also the ablity to save as many fossil fuels we have remaining cause everyone knows we are starting to run completly out and can not creat any more. By doing this we save time and energy and creat a healthy envirnment.

If we slowly progress the fact that we are only using our automobiles 345/360 days a year will cut back our usage for fossile fuels by 15%. This whole thing is point less how they have us in here for two days im missing my education. We could have finished this in one day and had the rest of the week to get back on the track of learning. I've missed both days of weight lifting, algebra, and my world history that i do not want to fail again! If their are any people actually gonna sit down and take the time to read this then

DO NOT DO THIS NEXT YEAR

.

They are giving us cold lunches. ham and cheese and an apple, I am 16 years old and my body needs proper food. I wouldnt be complaining if they served actual breakfast. but because of Michelle Obama and her healthy diet rule they surve us 1 poptart in the moring. How does the school board expect us to last from 7:05-12:15 on a pop tart? then expect us to get A's, we are more focused on lunch than anything else. I am about done so if you have the time to read this even though this does not count. Bring PROPER_NAME a big Mac from mc donalds, SCHOOL_NAME, (idk area code but its in LOCATION_NAME)       Â
