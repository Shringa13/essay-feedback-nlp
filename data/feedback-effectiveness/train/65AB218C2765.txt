Unmasking the face on Mars??

Face on Mars??? The face on mars is just a natural landform. Mars has plenty of landforms and its normal for landforms to creat a shape or face. Just because it makes a face on a planet doesn't mean aliens had anything to do with it. Under paragraph 5 you see a photograph of the face and many landforns surrounding it, so as you can see many landforms stand out on Mars.

In paragraph 3 it says (shadoes gave the landform eyes,a mouth,and nose) so its a landform with a face but the shadows make up the face. NASA has been studying this for a long time,but for what ?, as you bcan see its just a landform not a face.

In paragraph 7 it clearly says(thousands of web surfers were waiting when the image on the JPL website but when it appeared it revealed just a natural landform.). There was no momument after all. So in conclusion with this evidence, you can clearly see that its just a landform and not a alien monument.
