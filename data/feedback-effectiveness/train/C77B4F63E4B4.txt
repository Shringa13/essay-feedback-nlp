Dear senator,

I belive that Electoral college is unfair in many ways, and maybe it would be good to keep the election by popular vote for the United States. The reasons why changing the election to Electoral college would be; smaller states would not see the candates because they would go to the bigger states like California, Texas and other states that are bigger then ohio or south carolina some of this states didn't even see a campaing ad how sad is that because this country is know for the equalness off every one but yet the electoral college forgets about seventeen states that are small because their vote doesn't matter.?

Keeping the election by popular vote would be the best. The fact that the people of the United States are able to see and vote for whom they perfer not the electors who elect the president. You might think that keeping the electoral college election is not as bad or unfair because it can help elect a president when the one of the presidents vote are majotite of vote it can help a run off election but I beive the best way to select the president of the U.S would be by letting the people chosse what they think is the best so the people know they are noticed in this contry.
