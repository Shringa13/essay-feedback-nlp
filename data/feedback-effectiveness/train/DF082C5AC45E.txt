Imagine growing up in a city 30 miles above the ground and wearing a suit all the time to protect yourself from the envirement. This is life on the planet of Venus. There are many dangers such as the temperature being 800 degrees Fahrenheit, the pressure that is 90 times greater than what we experience on earth, and clouds of sulfuric acid everywhere but is it worth it?

In this article there are many reasons to not explore Venus, some say it may not be able to be done but NASA belives that if we use a blimp like vehicle to explore 30 miles above the surface then the temperature will drop to around 170 and the pressure will drop aswell.

There is a saying "The needs of the many out weigh the needs of the few" and in the situation of our planet being compremised in one way or another that is very true. If we need another planet to flee to we could go to Venus but we would need exstensive research first in order to find out if it is even possible to survive on that planet.

Life would be a lot more difficult living on Venus but based on this article it might just be possible. Living on Venus would mean we would have to make tons of improvements in our technology so they wouldn't be totally inferior in the extreme conditions of Venus's weather. Our tech would have to able to handle all of the heat and everything else without over heating and exploding all the time.

In conclusion I think the author did a good job in explaining the conditions of the Venus and all of its surprises it holds for us to find. The author also adresses the technology advancements we would have to make aswell as gives us motivation to explore and create by saying "Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation."
