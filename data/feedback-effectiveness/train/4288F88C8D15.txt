I think if your good and sports you can participate in sports. But you atleast have to try to do better at school. Because if you don't them you can't participate in sports like compate with others school or team. It so cool because, one time I compate with other school in baskteball and voleyball. But we lost In voleyball but in basketball we won. I was So happy because you get so exited and then nervous because then you think that your going to lose but you never know ig you don't try. So I think that if you have a C or B you can still make to the team or do some sprots. When I won I was with a C avarage and my coach. Didn't care she put me because I was good. And that what I think principal so please don't change the rules. And if i want to do and acticity well if I have a C than, she atleast can check my conduct in class. Or maybe some student don't have a B avarage they could got and C and they could be one of the best. But the pricipal want to change the rule right.
