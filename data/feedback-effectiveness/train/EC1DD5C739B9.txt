Exploring Venus

I wounder why Venus called the "Evening star" I think venus sometimes call the evening star because its a bright planet and it shine like a star & its the second planet from our sun. And venus referred to earth's twin because venus is the closest planet to earth. If I was an anstronount I would love to explore venus because it would be fun to be walking on venus.

Most people should join venus just to see how it look and how is it. I think NASA

as our jet airplanes travel at higher altitude to fly over many storms to go into space and explore many plants.

The national aeronautics and space administartion have done a great job when they go into space and discover planets. I think it is very cool to go on other planets venus is sometimes closers to mars. The earth rotated its self and people dont nocited it.

The sun is the hottest planet in the solar system it is over 100's degrees. Long ago venus was probaly coverd largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life just like earth.

Today, venus still has some features that are analogous to those on earth but venus is one of the best planet in the solar system.
