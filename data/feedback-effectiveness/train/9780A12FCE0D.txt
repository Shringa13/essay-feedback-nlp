Dear principle,

I was informed that you are deciding whether to require all student to perform community service. I wanted to take the opportunity to talk to you about what i think about this situation.

i think that everyone should be required to do community service at least once a week. i believe that with at least one day that each student does it, it will help the school and our community.

If you approve of this our school will become cleaner and our library will become more organized and the kids from the elementary school would really appreciate if we could lend them a hand. If we all could participate in this program our student will think twice about throwing a piece of wrapper on the floor.

Most student disagree with me because they say that it isn't their responsibility to pick up after someone else. They also say that they don't get anything out of performing community service but i think that if each student does community service that maybe we could raffle a prize out every month or so, so that they could get motivated to do the service. Or maybe for every two hour they do of community service they could get a hour of detention taken off.

I think that with my proposition our student will want to participate in our weekly community service program.

I hope that you make the correct decision, that is best for the school, the district and our community.

Thank You
