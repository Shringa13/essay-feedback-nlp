The plant Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size. In space terms humans is ometimes right around the corner in space ters humans have sent numerus spaceraft to land on this cloud draped world. In Venus there are thing that we need because in page 3 it said " On the planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit."
