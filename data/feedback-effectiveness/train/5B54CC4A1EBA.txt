This technology should not be used in a classroom environment. This way of telling emotions is just telling your facial expressions but not judging your emotions on the inside.

The pronblem is that technology can't tell all emotions. sometimes people look mad or sad but are really happy, if the computer is just looking the expression on your face then its really not doing anything. "Empathy (feeling someone else's emtional state) may happen because we unconsciously imitate another person's facial expression"(Ph9), when the author states this it shows that not all of our humanliy facial expressions give off our emotions. They have only tried this on a still frame pricture.

Emotions are not just expressions on a face but its also a feeling inside so if the computer can actually feel the way someone is feeling then this sort of technology could work. "of course, most of us would have trouble actually describing each facial trait..."(Ph5), we have these troubles because we are notfeeling what they are feeling.

In all this would not be a good idea because the results would not be accurate. Emotions are like feelings and can't 100% told by a computer. The pricing on this all of this must be tremendous and if school do want this technology they would have to consider that aspect of the deal.
