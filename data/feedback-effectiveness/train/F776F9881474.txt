Have you ever had to do a summer project because I have and it sucked because the project that the teacher gave me was boring but if I got to choose my summer project I would choose something that I will enjoy and be able to learn.

If students had a choice to pick a summer project or let the teacher decide I am pretty sure most if not all of the students will let them self choose. I remember when I was in like 5th or 6th grade and my teacher was like "I know its the end of the year but you guys and girls are gonna have to do a summer project". After she said that everyone hated her for the rest if the summer and not just because she gave us a summer project but also because it was very boring but if it was not boring then I am pretty sure everyone would not be as mad as they were.

I believe that if students got to choose the summer project then more students will get it done. I know for a fact that if I was to get a summer project it would not most likely not get done but if I had a choice to pick it or have my teacher pick it I would pick it my self any day of the week. If I would was to choose my own summer project then I am almost 100% sure most kids would like to pick their own summer project. Just like 2 summers ago I had to go to summer school because I was not doing so good in my cases and the teacher said that all we had to do was a project and we would be all good and we will be ok to go to the next grade so I was relived so I went home and got started on it but when I got started I realized that it was boring and if something was boring I was probaly not going to get it done.

I am saying all of this to say I think that if schols make kids do summer projects they should be able to pick what they are going to do because it will be more fun, more kids will do it, and it gives a chance for kids to think on their own.
