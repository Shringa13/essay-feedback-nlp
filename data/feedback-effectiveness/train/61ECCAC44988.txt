The Challenge of Exploring Venus

Every planet is different and unique in their own way. Every planet is known for what they are and I'm going to talk about Venus.

Venus is our second planet in our solar system, many people agree and disagree that studying Venus is and is not pursuit despite the dangers it presents of the author saying and I agree with the author because it could be dangerous enough if someone would go up in space and not be prepared. Reasons why I think it wouldn't be a good idea because in the text in paragraph six it says that "Many researchers are working on innovations that would allow our machines to last long enough to contribute meaningfully to our knowledge of Venus". In my own words I believe it is not safe because what if it doesn't last long ?

I believe that Venus is a good planet but it's not safe studying in Venus. I understand that people may disagree but everyone safety is important first when they go up in space.
