I think for the election for presidency its should be counted on the popular vote. Why I think it should be on the popular vote is because it should count on what the people vote on,not on the electoral college. We should be the people to have the vote on the president and not just a piece of it. Plus the electoral colleges don't even vote on the president,they vote on a slate for the electors who then vote for president.

voting should be on the popular vote now because the electoral colleges are not even voting on the president they're voting on the electors who vote for president. When if there was a direct vote we would then be voting just for the president. Yes sometimes we would vote someone else for president by accident ,but not as much as the electoral college does.

thats why I think we should have a direct vote instead of having the electoral colleges voting for us pretty much. It just sounds like it would woork better if the people voted for president and not the people voinng for elctors who then vote for the president.       Â
