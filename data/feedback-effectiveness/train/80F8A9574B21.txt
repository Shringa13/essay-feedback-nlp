Dear senator, i think that you should change the electoral collage. the reason for that is because i " the foundin fathers establish it in the constitution as a compromise between election of the president by a vote in congress and election of the president by popular vote of qualified citizens."  in which that if we been doing this for century the people votes never really mattered because voters vote not for the president , but for a slate of electors,who in turn elect the president. well i didnt know people need some  for some one to turn back around and they deside who they want to vote for. its stupid and a waste of people times because sometimes you cant control who your electors vote for. " the single best argument against the electrol collages." they would call it the disaster factor the reason for that is the american people should consider them self lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century ; the system allows much worse, consider that states legislaturs are technically responsible for picking electors, and that those electors i " could always defy the will of the people." proving my point making the peoples votes useless. they did this in 1960 , segregationists in the louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the democratic electors with new electors who oppose john F. kennedy. so that a popular vote for kennedy would not have actually gone to kennedy. see theres more reason for electoral collages to be of no use and be bad but i think you got the point right ? people votes should actually matter senator and not be use to vote for some one else to vote so they can end up choosing some one else. so please stop electoral collage.

sincerally, sammy the bull.
