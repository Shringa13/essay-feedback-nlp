Most students after coming from a stressful day in school often choose to lay in the couch, watch TV or play video games and stay up really late, they can even sometimes forget to eat or eat a bunch of snacks.

Having students participate in at least one extracurricular activity allows them to socialize with students, participate in activities they enjoy or even find something new to try. For some students it can be hard to manage their time at home or might not be able to fit a few hours to complete these activities in their schedule. If your having difficulties with time, its important to communicate with your parents, I am sure they can figure something out.

When students do outdoor activities or school activities it can help them keep things off their minds like, problems at home,in school or in certain places outside. Its important to try keeping stress and anxiety the farthest away from students to help them stay focused in school and become successful.

Wouldnt you rather see your kid doing activities and becoming successful than wasting their young life doing unnecessary things that wont help them later in life? We all want whats best for students and want to help them achieve their goals, which is why we should allow students to participate in at least one extracurricular activity.
