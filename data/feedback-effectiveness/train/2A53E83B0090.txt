- The author does support the idea very well of studying Venus is worthy of pursuit despite the dangers.

- Venus is a cloud draped planet, it is often referred as Earth's twin because Venus is the closest planet to Earth and sometimes Mars, humans sent spacecraft to Venus but unmanned because not one single spaceship has touched down in Venus in three decades, humans have to study everything about Venus because of Venus's reputation it is a very challenging planet.

- Venus was used to be the most Earth-like planet in our solar system because long ago it was covered with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth. Venus still has some features such as valleys, mountains, and craters. NASA has a compelling idea for sending humans to study Venus. Many researchers are working on innovations that would allow our machines to last long enough to contribute meaningfully to our knowledge of Venus.

- NASA is working on other approaches to studying Venus. Striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiousity will likely lead us into many equally imtimidating endeavors.
