Venus is like the non explorable planet. The technology we have in the world today is not good enough to wistand the envirnment of Venus with its extremely harsh conditions. One of the things the is keeping people so interested is that Venus at one time was supposedly the most Earth like planet in our solar system.

We have tried to explore Venus multiple times but the explorations have been un named because after a few our the spacecrafts broke or quit on us. We think that this is because of Venuses harsh envirnement constisting of acid rain and clouds, the hottest surface temprature in our Milky Way, and the fact that it is so hard to catch the planet when it is close to our planet. "Also notteble Venus has the hottest surface temprature of any planet in the solar system, even though mercury is the closest to the Sun". Thats a reason why we cant land and stay there. One of the reasons we believe Venus used to be like Earth is because of its nottable past. "Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like earth".

We are working on more developed technology as the years go by, but we are still not able tpo land and stay on Venuses surface. We are getting closer but are not ready or prepared to try again yet.
