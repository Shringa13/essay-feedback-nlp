Dear TEACHER_NAME

I think if a student has a c average you should give him or a chance. It would be un fair cause if a student did his or her best and all the could give is a c then you should let them play. A lot of students aren't able to pull of a b average so give those students a chance to play sports. So will you change that policy for all the students that pull of a b average cause a c average isn't that bad they are still passing but they can play sports and anything else they want.

This is how i feel about your policy, there are so many students that only have sports some people that don't have sports they end up doing nothing. People drop out of school cause they think if they don't have the grades to play sports they cant do anything with their life. So i know you don't want that to happen so take some time and think about it what you are doing. Before you make your finale decision. So can you please change it.

sincerely
