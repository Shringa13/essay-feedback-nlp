The face on mars is not caused by aliens, that is upcerd. Aliens wouldnt make a face on mars because their is no such thing of them doing so. The face you see on mars is just a detailed rock formation that formed by natural causes, and also the eyes, mouth, and nose are just shadows caused by the formation.

Aliens would'nt accure on mars to make a mark, if they were real they would be much farther then mars. This landform has been their for over 18 years so the odds are not aliens but erosion on the planet mars. Back then itwasnt seeable but now it is due to these erosions. If their were alians that made the formation People would've already be talking about the alien sightings.

This is why the formation was not made by aliens. Also any aircrafts, small shacks, or airplains would be able to be seen in the picture due to the pixels in the camera. The camera would be able to see anything that goes on mars. All of the details that you see is just shadows from the rock That makes it look like it has eyes, a mouth, and a nose, and thats why the face is a natural land form and not made by alens.
