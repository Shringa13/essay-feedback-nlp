I disagree with the students attend classes form home or vidoe conferencing the reason why i diagree with this online thing is that one of are student will not get on, they will fall asleep and they will not do there work the by them doin gthis alot of kids can fail reason why i say this things because i know students im am one; that me explain to you why I say this .

The frist reason why I said students will not get on because they will be like i get on next time and keep on saying in till they think it not useful at all then they will not get on and just go outside and play with there friends or sometimes there Mom or Dad have to keep telling to get on and they migth not listen to them or just get on there ps4 or phone .

Number two reason is that they can fall asleep while on it and the teacher cant do nothing about it but if we was at class a real class they can tell us to get up and make sure we doing what we suppost to do by going to class that can make the teacher work way more easy for them.

Last reason but not least is that they will not do there work they will get on but how can you know they the one doing it they can get someone eles that they know or just pay them to do it for them teen are bad but smart. However other migth say the students attend classes form home is the best thing they can do because they dont need to do all that monring things they can just open the laptop and join there teacher form the web cam and learn but other cant learn like that they need someone rigth next to them so the students can understand more better. That why I diagree with this students attend schools from home .
