i just wont to write to the principal at school about the the school policy about the phone . i think the kids at school should have there phones just when they need them like if something goes wrong maybe they will need to call for help so that's what i thing we need to change at to keep kids safe.

the kids at school just don't bring them to school to play they need them for good use to let someone or something know what is going on at school if they maybe did something wrong or just to tell someone something. that's why the phone can be a good policy on and at school for every school if the kids need one for there safety and own risk to there life. now i think all students should have a phone at school not to play on them but for there safe keep.
