Dear principal,

I think its unfair to mandate community service. Some people think its a great i idea to do community service, but for some people it just takes to much time!

If we had more time on our hand then i would be all for community service, but don't have a lot of time to do anything after school. Our teachers give us too much home work and not enough time to do it all and now if it becomes mandatory to do community service no one will have any time to do anything but homework and community service. That is unfair and unjust taking a way our personal time. Before the only time i had to myself was sleeping, and now i will have to spend that picking up trash. Or reading to the blind. Or tutor elementary school students. Or spending my time with old people that have Alzheimer's disease, who can even remember the last time they went to the bath room. That is a court sentence, not what you do for school.

I understand that what your considering doing is for a good cause. But leave community service to people who want to do it and can do it. Not to people that are being forced to.

Sincerely,
