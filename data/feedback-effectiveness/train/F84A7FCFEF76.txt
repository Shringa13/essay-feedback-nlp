The author supports his or her evidence by giving us what Venus is like before astronauts try to explore Venus. They give a brief paragraphs of what Venus is like and the last time NASA to explore Venus. Venus is a hard planet to go even though it right behind the sun. Human being can probably not handle the preasure that is on Venus so it can be dangerous. Venus can be a good planet to discver in the article it mentions that we us has human beings, havent touch the surface of Venus. The author also gives us the similarites that Venus had before Earth was around.

NASA has explored the moon and that's how far we have been and we never wen't farther than that. It's good to learn about Venus and it's ways and were it is located in our solar system but trying to put a human being on planet that has servre weather, temperatrue changes, and not the right oxygen can be very dangerous. Despiteing danger can be bad because that person will ony focus on the good things they heard about that planet and what it was like. They never focus on what the danger part of going on a such a dangerous trip. NASA should could do more reasearch on Venus before they go anywhere. It cool to strive for a new challlenge in Earth historty, but if this mission was succesful trip people will only focuse they would'nt focus on the flashbacks of putting other people that have families life on the and the have chance of dieing on g this jounrney to Venus.
