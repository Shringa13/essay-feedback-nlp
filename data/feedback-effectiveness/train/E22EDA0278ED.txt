We should explore venus and three ressons why are that people can not survive the landing, and the air is 97% carbon dioxide, and lastly the enviorment is really hot too hot that people can not be able to live on.

And one resson that we sould start to explore venus is that people can not survive the landing to venus and a quot from the text is "no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours." and that proves we need to start exploring venus because it shows us our mistakes in our space craft. Just think of how we will be able to improve our studys in space exploration. And we can upgrade our spaceships to spacecrafts maybe.

And anouther reson on why we need to keep exploring mars is how there is 97% of carbon dioxide in the ai. and one pice of evidence from the text is "A thick atmoshere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide. " And that is anouther reson to keep studdying mars, because we can learn how is was created and how it got there and also how long people live there before they die so many posibilatys that we can have about gasmask and air chambers.

And lastly the final reson on why we shouldn't end the venus exploration is that the heat the planet has. and one piece of evidnce that the text gives us about on hot venus is, is " on the planet's surface temperatures average over 800 degrees fhrenheit" and that shows us that we can learn on how to live on hot planets without buring into a crips also it shows us how far we can go with our air coolers to try to lower the heat.

And that is all the ressons why we should not stop exploring venus.
