The use of this technology to read students' emotional expressions is a good idea. I think this is a good idea because say a student was having a bad day at school, the computer can tell if you are having a bad day and so the teacher wouldnt ask any questions, try to make you stand infront of the class reading a book or doing a math problem on the board. This technology will help both the student and the teacher have a better and more understanding relationship.

This article "Making Mona Lisa Smile." shows many examples or evidence that support my claim like; " The facial expressions for each emotion are universal," observes Dr. Huang, "even though individuals often show varying degrees of expression" (like not smiling as broadly). Using video imagery, the new emotion-recognition software tracks these facial movements--in a real face or in the paited face of the Mona Lisa. Another example supporting my claim is " A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored," Dr. Huang predicts. " Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."

This is a great and fun way to use technology, it will help teachers modify their lessons to fit not only the schools need of teaching but the students way of learning. The students will no longer be confused about an assignment instead, they will be able to learn and grow better than if they was in a regular classroom. This is why I think we should have Facial Action Coding System in our classrooms.
