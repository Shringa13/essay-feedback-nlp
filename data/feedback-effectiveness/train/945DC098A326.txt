DEAR,SENATOR

I overheard that you are thinking on should we keep the electoral college or not use it any more. the electoral college is the amount of popoltaion  a state has. the distrct of columbia has only 3 beacause its not a state . in my opinino i think its stupid that you have to vote on the population , aka a president cant just have a state like florida or ct just have a state like florida or cali. now its true that the presidental election is very important  but it shouldint have to be taken like this . the presidents always pick the states with the most population or points. yes i think that the electoral college is useless maybe in a draw or something. but the vote should count for everyone no matter what state there in. the state is not the points the people are . most states dont have any campanie ads any where cuz they know that they dont hav e much points .other parties like green party and the tea party they should be more out htere the just demo anf rep. the elector college is widely know as a non-democratic way to vote for presidents. othere parties are imoprtant to like the green party is one of the best ones im my opionio but they have that winner take all system. t most people diagree with the system in place but they cant do nothing. larger states get more attention then the smaller states because the president needs more points . the states not might be bigger in size but population may be bigger .
