Do you think its is a good idea to limit car usage? Well i do and the reason for that is because more people now a days just have completely stop caring about the enviornment. I say this because more and more people are getting these big trucks and they are not realizing that when that truck starts it is letting out bad gases that harms our atmosphear.

I read that people are now getting fines in Columbia because of there cars and right now i think that's a good idea. I say this because people are just down right lazy and they need to get up and go exercise, they could just go walk or even ride a bike to where they have to go, it's really not that hard.

Next I read that president Obama has abitious goals to curb the united states greenhouse gas emission. I know that it will work out because I read that peopel think that america is pass the car age or what ever and that more and more people are starting to do whats right and start walking and riding bikes.

Now I have also read that Car compinies are suffering from that one day without cars thing because i think they fear that people might love the day without cars so much,that they just might stop buying them. Car componies are also suffering because I read that more and more people are becoming unemployed or they just cant affored it so they take alternet ways to get to where they have to go and they just dont worry about it.

These are some of the reasons why i think it is a good idea that we should limit the usage in this world because there are so many pro's and cons on why its a good/bad idea.
