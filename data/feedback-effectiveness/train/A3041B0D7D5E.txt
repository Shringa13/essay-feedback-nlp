In the article "The challenge of Exploring Venus," the author suggests that studying Venus is a worthy to go explore from the dangers that Venus has. An evidence that it says that the author is supporting this idea is in paragraph five. In paragraph it says that " Solor power would be plentiful, and raidiation would not exceed Earth level. Not easy condition, but survivable for humans."

In the bottom of the second paragraph it says "Numerous factors contribute to Venus's reputation as a challenge plant for humans to study, despite its proximity to us." In paragraph the author is describing how Venus was like a long time ago, covered with large oceans and that it could of have supported various forms of life. The author also describes how the planet looks like today with rocks, valleys, and mountains.

In paragragh six it talks about how researchers and scientist are working on innovations that would make the machines last long enough while exploring Venus. Paragraph six also talks about how researchers can't take any rocks, gas, or anything that is from Venus, to no make it a risk and researchers can't take pictures or videos that well because the light of the picture or video cannot penetrate the dense of the atmoshere which is ineffective.

In the bottom of paragraph seven it says that " Just imagine exposing a cell phone or tablet to acid or heat capable of melting tin. By comparison, system that use mechanical parts can be made more resistant to pressure, heat, and other forces." I think that reseachers and scientist are learning more and more about humans going to Venus to see if it is safe to go.
