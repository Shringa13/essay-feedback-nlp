In this short story the authoer is sayiing thet it is not woth you time to study venus. it not with the time but it is a star that shines bright inthe sky at nigh time. The author said "the value of returning to venus seems indisputable, but what are the opitions for making such a mission both safe and scientifically productive". it not safe to send to someone int to space to venus becasue they do not know if they will be able to get them back to earth safely. for other reason, " NASA's possible solution to the hostile condititons on the surface of venus would allow scientists to float above the roiling venusian landscape. with means that venus landscape it not good for people to be up ther on it surface, scientist do jnot know if there is right oxygen on that planet for humans to breath. With that

"NASA is working on other approaches to study venus", because they are now thinking that it not safe for them to send humans upp to space to get data for them because they don't know what it like on that planet or how the weather , the surface is for humans to be on it. NASA is goimg to be useing technology with they call " mechanical computers" to studdy the planet here on earth. but venus is now called" the evening star brightest points of light in the night sky".
