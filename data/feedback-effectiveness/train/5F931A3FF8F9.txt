Even after proven wrong, people are still thinking that the face on mars is an actual alien made face. In paragraph 10 it staes that on April 5th 1998 a global surveyor flew over Cydonia with a camera 10 times sharper than the photo taken in the original 1976 picture, shown to prove that on this picture the closer up it looks less like a face. But this wasn't the end of the research.

The reaseach continues but with an even better camera to try and prove all of the conspiracy believing people wrong. In paragraph 11 it states that the new digital image taken in 2001, was a 3 times bigger sized camera from the 1998 photo, and it was sharper than ever. This image spans over 1.56 meters! If this "face" was made by aliens, then why were there no artifacts found around the photograph? The extremely high def. picture would have shown said artifacts. But there are still specticals believing otherwise.

The pictures are proven to be a natural born landform, pictures don't lie. Yes, maybe if we were ON Mars we would find some new facts to maybe prove one anothers views even more, but for right now NASA is winning. Conspiracy theories are theories. Picture evidence is pure fact shown to a persons face.

Just like the belief in wether or not earth and people were made by god or science. They're both theories that's why people have to have "faith" in what they believe. The Big Bang theory for example is a theory because it doesn't have enough evidence to be proven that it legitimately happened. It goes the same with religion.

In conclusion, people all have thir different beliefs. Some believe that the "face" was alien made, some believe it's natural born. But no matter what people believe, fact is fact. What would you believe, a conspiracy (something not officially proven) or a fact with picture evidence?
