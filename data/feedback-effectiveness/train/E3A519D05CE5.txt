Dear Principal,

Although I understand why you would reconsider the policy I believe it could go either way.

Some students may take advantage of the policy and secretly use it in class.

Others might take embarrassing photos of somebody else and ruin their life.

The only way to stop this from happening is to ban cell phones for good, however that can also take away the privileges that some students deserve, so what should happen to the policy?

Here is my answer.

I think cell phones should be allowed in school.

Many students use their cell phones for entertainment.

Homework, schoolwork and other things take up a lot of the time in our lives and cell phones help give some people a break but at the same time it could distract them from their work.

However I think that is a price to pay sometimes.

If cell phones help us in our social ways and happiness we shouldn't take it away.

Yes, it does take us off task or can even disrupt our education but it's up to us individually when we think its enough.

We take education to help us have a brighter future and cell phones may get in the way but if we all come together, our community or even the whole world and help each other out then we can still have a bright future.

However, what good would it be if we're not having fun along the way?

In conclusion, I think cell phones should be allowed in school during free times.

If someone is using it when they shouldn't then they can be punished but let's not leave anyone in the dark if they are having a problem.

If we help each other out then the world will definitely be a better place.

Sincerely,
