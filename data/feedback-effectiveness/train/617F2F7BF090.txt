I am personally against the policy that states that a student has to maintain a B or better average to play a sport or participate in activities. To sustain a C average without playing sports is one thing. But if someone sustains a C average while playing one or more sports is actually quite an undertaking. See I play sports and I have an A average but believe me its not even relatively close to being easy. I believe that other rules having to do with the sports themselves should be altered before there is a change in the grade requirements.

The reason kids have such a challenge with grades while playing a sport is because to commit to a sport while balancing it with school is a tremendous undertaking. This is because while playing a sport you may have a two to three hour practice three to four times a week not including a game or two, that you have to play in each week. Another effect of sports on grades is that they leave you tired and exhausted, which makes it much harder to keep focused in a classroom environment.

If you are going to change something about the sports program change how long the practice can be or the amount of practices allowed per week. That in itself will give the student athletes more breathing room so they will have an easier time bringer their grades up. If these work than you can keep the required average at a C, but if these fail, that is when you would be obliged to make the required average a B so the students have more drive to keep their grades up. But at the time I think you should change the limitations of the sports programs in itself before any of the grade requirements are changed.
