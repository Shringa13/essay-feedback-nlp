Dear State Senator,

My name is PROPER_NAME and I am in favor of changing to election by a popular vote for the president of the United States. I believe that the people should have more of a say in who runs our nation and I also believe that we might be a better nation if we were the ones who decided who ran it.

The Electoral College does not let the people of the nation speak, 538 electors speak for the billions in the United States of America. Also, if the electors vote and the results come out to be a tie, the election now has to be put into the hands of the House of Representatives. Being as there is only one vote from each state allowed the results will probably not reflect the choices and wishes of the people.

The Electoral College is an old compromise the was made by the founding fathers, but some changes have to be made to fit the modern times and ways. With the way society is built now changes to some of the political aspects of the country have to be made.

Although the Electoral College has its pros, such as its setup for if a tie is made, there are more cons in the situation. So with that I am asking that you think about the people and try to change some of the ways of the United States political system.

Sincerely,

PROPER_NAME
