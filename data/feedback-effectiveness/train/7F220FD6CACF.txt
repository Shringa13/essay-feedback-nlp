The use of this technology to read the emotional expressions of students is a good idea. Some students want there emtions to them selfs and want to know there emitons. ''She's 82 percent happy. 9 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry." This new technology can calculate your emtions like math. Also using ''video imagery, the new emtion-recognition software tracks these facial movments - in a real face or in the painrted face of Mona Lisa.'' It can define the emotion of a real human and in a painting. There technology is very intresting they construct a 3-D computer model to the face. instead of humans trying to find out calculations them selfs they can use the new technology. Humans can perform the same way as the new technology even tho they are gonna have to estimate the percentigs. Also can tell when children or students are tired or bored or falling as sleep so then the technolgy '' could modity the lesson, like and effective human instructor. The same technology can make computers-animated faces more expressive- for video games or video surgery.'' so it can keep the students on track and still learn on there school lessons and wont get behind. Whoever thought that making faces could reveal so much about the science of emtions. Students can change there face exprishions but the new technolgy can tell that not there real expertion. The new use of this technology to read the emtional expersions of students is a good idea. The technology will be a helpful thing in the near future for all of the school to keep the studetns on track and wont get lost on there lessons. this new technolgy wlll help students alot.
