I would keep the Electoral College because it consists of the selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for president and Vice president, and the counting of the electoral votes by congress. If people want to change the election for popular votes  is basically your generallly chosen by the candidates politcal party...and what their responsibilities are. My response to that not everybody is chosen by politcal party.

Now, if people want to change the election by popular voting is held every four years on the Tuesday after the first Monday in November. You help choose your states electors when you vote for presidents because when you vote for your candidates you are actually voting for your candidates electors. My response to that is..sometimes presidents want to be president because "they want to change everything in the United States like ..taxes..and health insurance. For example like Obama care he has change the health insurance and people dont like that. And 2016 theres going to be a new President in the United States.
