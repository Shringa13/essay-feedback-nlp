Science could be where we can possibly find advances and great inventions for the future. Now in days a machines can tell you how exactly you feel!. We are humans, but technology could change how we think, how we act and high chances how we live.

First of all, technology have changed how humans can be in the future like computers. But technolgy can have a negative impact too. Proffesor Thomas Huan, invented A new technology called the Facial Action Coding System can let humans know how they feel. They could even read your facial actiond

"There are more experts at developing better ways for humans and computers to comunicate." do you think science has gone too far?

Second, somethimes you can harshly tell when a friend its mad or happy.

How would you feel knowing that a computer knows every single emotion that you are feeling at the moment and the percentage for example 5% angry, 78% happy, 2% disgusted etc. The creator of this technology started with the basic emotions which are happiness,surprie, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness. It would be creepy when you "Imagine a computer taht knows if your happy or sad."

Third, humans make calculations and guess the emotions of others. For instance, you can infer how a friend feels or just by looking at their face but you can't tell an accurate number of emotions like the computers."A classroom computer can recognize when a student is becoming confused or boring." with the big advances of technology we might not act like humans in the future.

In conclusion, Science play an importent roll in technology and technology have created machines that can tell your emotions. We are humans and by the advance of technology, future then might change the way we act, think and possibly live our lives.
