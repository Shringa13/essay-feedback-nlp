In my opinion, the students tanking to attend classes from home, by way of oline or video conferencing. I think the students not have benefit from being able to attent classes from home.

First, the students has more distraction in home; with vedeo play, and othe oction, more students work a time with taking a class, more with have a classes in distance, the schools need a tanking a other options. With lern in school the students are more specific learn, with a have a teacher opposite the student to learnig more specific, when she tanking the classes to has a more effective for a students.

Second, I hink this option for learning offer the class in distance wich a attend classes from home; not is a good option for example: in my house a have three brothers, and one sister, I think is distraction wich learning in home.

In finally; with reason with not is good idea the learning a distance the school, I think is more elementary, basic to taking the video conferencing online, because; learning more in the watch the vedeo conference, with online; is more effective memorize with the morning in not in evening, the students have forceful in the morning, but no think this is a good option for a students, not have a good benefit from being able to attend classes from home.

Conclucion; the students not taking the classes from the house or distance learning, but students learning more when she go to the schools. The parents thinks exactly whit me, because is most effective taking the classes in the schools, in not a distance the schols.Â
