Do you think the Face is just a natural landform or a face proving alien life forms? Do you think it is bona fide evidence for life on Mars? I'm a scientist at NASA and the Face, a lot of people seem to think was formed by aliens or is proof of alien life forms, is actually just a natural landform. The Face is just a natural landform because it was a cloudy day on Mars when the spacecraft took the pictures, you would be able to see objects in the pictures if there were any, and the picture actually shows the Martian.

The Face is just a natural landform on the planet of Mars, not something created by alien life forms or evidence of life on Mars. For example, when the pictures were taken, it was a cloudy day on Mars. The clouds casted shadows on the landform to make it look like a face. There were no alien markings. If there were objects in the pictures you would be able to see them. You would be able to see the objects because you can discern things in a digital image three times bigger than the pixel size. The picture actually shows the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa. They are common around the American West.

Do you still think the Face on Mars was actually created by aliens? Do you still think it is bona fide evidence of life on Mars? The Face is just a natural landform because pictures were taken on a cloudy day, where the clouds could cast shadows on the landform. You would also be able to see any objects in the pictures if there were any. There is a chance of life on Mars because there is water found on Mars. The Face is not evidence of life on Mars.
