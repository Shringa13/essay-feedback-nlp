The Face of Mars isn't a face at all! It's just the shadows that gives the eyes, nose and mouth a look. It could be possible for the aliens to create the Face of Mars but it'll take ages for the aliens to perform a task like that. The Face of Mars is only a Natural Landform that has been around Mars since it was created.

The Face of Mars is located in Cydonia in Mars. Since Mars is mostlikely cloudy, the photos were taken when Mars was cloudless and was in open in Cydonia. MGS had took enough pictures during those times when it cloudless. Pictures were taking for many reasons. One of the reasons was for taxpayers. Jim Garvin, a chief scientist for NASA's Mars Exploration Program, wanted this to happen for profit. But, some other reasons were to learn about Mars and it's surroundings for the next ship to travel there.

It really wasn't build by aliens nor any other creature out in space. The Face of Mars was made 25yrs ago. No one knows how it was made but it was located in Cydonia on Mars.

The Face, however, is an illusion using the shadows as the eyes, mouth, and the nose. One day in Sept. 1997, MGS, or Mars Global Surveyor, had landed onto the Red Planet had confirmed it as a natural landform. Not everyone was satisfied since they wanted more proof for this. It was April '98, cloudy time of year on Mars, where people couldn't use their telescopes to see the Face for themselves. So, on April 8th, 2001, MGS gotten close enough for another look. They've took another picture using a better camera that could see anything clear like a airplane, a truck, or a Egyptian-style pyramids! Once they've gotten the picture, People were satisfied.

Aliens never made the Face of Mars and the Face of Mars isn't real at all! It's just a natural landform by having the shadows covering up most of the landform making it appear as a face. For the conclusion, Cydonia has a natural landform on it that appears itself as a face using the shadows to make the illusion.
