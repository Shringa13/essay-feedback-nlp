Theres two diffrent type of ways to vote for election. There is electoral college or voted by popularity of people. I beleive citizens should vote for there president so they can have a right on who to vote on. Electoral college is a only voted by congress according to Richard Nioxn,Jimmy Carter and Bob Dole the U.S. chamber of commerce and the AFL-CIO all agreed on Abolishing the eletoral college.

2. Eelectoral college is voted not for the president its voted for the slate for example if you lived in texas for insurance and wanted to vote for Jhon Kerry you have voted for a slate. Richard A. Posner Electoral college is widely regarded as non democratic method for selecting a president. From this method u can avoid run off elections or Big states. I beleive that this method is not the best. In conclusion citizens should have there rights to vote on who they want to be president.

3. citizens voting on who they want to be president is more rights for us. There is some negative for letting people vote for who they want president like citizens voting on a horrible president or have run offs were not that many people vote. I beleive this is a more efficent way to get votes from citizens. In conclusioun over 60 percent prefer a direct election to the kind we have no 4. I belevie that citizens voting for who they want is better than electoral college over 60 percent people vote for citizens having there own rights. At most basic levels the electoral colleges are unfair because many candidates dont take there time. In conclusion voting for your president is better.
