the autor suggestds that we should explore venus, personally i think it not a good idea but the author really does not support it and gives great examples to why we shouldt go out a study this beautifle planet called venus. on paragraph 3 the author really gives us great exam-les of the problems of exploring this planet one great exaple that i think will convince people from not going is that the authomosphere of venus is really thick and it is 97 percent carbon dioxcide which is bad for us , and also the temprature on average is 800 degrees which is pretty hot. As i saw read this part i noticed that the author isnt really against studiyng this planet he supports it.

On paragrapgh 4 he tells us that venus is simaller to earth becasue they have terrains just like ours, valleys,mountains ,and craters. The author also shares with us and writes that Nasa's possible solution to exploring or studying this amazing planet without having to touch the surface is float above the fray use an aircraft that is like blimp. This will only help them see the surface but they wont be able to collect rocks or soil which will be harder for them. One way Nasa is already working to be able to collect rocks is by using the computer used during World War 1 called mechanical computers. they can make calculation by usinf levers and gears. that way when they are up ther and send robots these can last longer and take data in, casue the modern computer tend to be fragile to heat. And in venus there is alot of heat. i believ the author really gave good details to why it is a good idea to studybthis amazing planet and really supported it now will see what time will show us. if we are the right thing like the aouthor writes "we should meet the very edges of imagination and innovation.
