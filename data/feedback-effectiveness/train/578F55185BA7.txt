I would try to do better in school so I would be able to play sports.

That is why I will do my work so I can play sports to get a scholarship in sports.

The reason I like to play sports is to be able to tell my son one day that I played sports when I was in school so he would like to play sports when he gets in the 6 -12 grade.

So that is why I try to keep my grades up so I can play sports.

When I get a good grade on my test and it is above 76 I am so happy that

I got a good grade on a test.

The reason I try to make good grades so I can go an stay at my friends house that is another reason I try to make good grades.

Another reason I like to keep my grades up is to be able to go to my moms house and that is one of my favorite places to go and stay. The other reasons I like to keep my grades up is so I don't get intruble so I do not have to do so much at the house and not being able to go fishing with my dad and that is another reason I like to get good grades. Another reason I like to get my grades up is so I can get to go to college.

The college that I would like to go to is Mississippi state University.
