I think using the Facial action coding system in students in a classroom is not good and the same thime bad. The students shouldt be using that they dont know what can go wrong.

The technology in 2018 is getting bigger and smarter. The technology is taking over jobs and everything. The facil action coding can be use for some important hings like like they can use it in the police office or somewhere that they really need it. The students can choose to use it or not they wont do it if they dont want to thats like making u do it. Some students will be surpice and some afraid of what might happen to them if something goes wrong. The technology makes alot of great things to hellp us who needs it. Teachnology can end up with the world if bad people do bad things to technology. I just want to be safe and have technology that helps me do good in my life. I maybe use the facial action coding to see how my emotions are but not use it for fun every minute. The Facial Action coding should work just find so all students can use it if is lik e we trying to see if it works good then the students shouldt use it.

I think that the Facial Action Coding should only be use when that person wants to try it and is not scare of what would happen if sometimes goes wrong while checking her or his emotions. Techology sometimes is bad and good but more times is for the good ways to us.
