Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I am fully aware you probably think it is better for the school to not have cell phones during school hours.

But I have reason to say that students should be able to have use in there phone during lunch periods and other free times but yet to have it off during class. The reason for this is because I tend to get bored during lunch time if I have absolutely nothing to do maybe I could just listen to music on my phone or to text a friend that is away. As well as if I needed to talk to my mom I could call her for something important to me, I say important to me because If I asked the people in the office if I could use the phone to ask my mom or a parent something, and did not tell them why because it was a personal question, they would normally say "no". I really don't see what is wrong with having a phone out during the time we have free. Kids do it either way, whether the teachers say yes or no, But kids sometimes get there phone look-in away. There for, I say we should be able to have use of a cell phone. I would rather much talk to you about this in person. Please respond to this letter I have sent you. Hopefully it would change your mind about this policy. If it didn't, sorry for bothering/interrupting your day. Thank you if you have read this paper I have wrote you.

Sincerely, STUDENT_NAME.
