The electoral college  system should be kept because it was established in the Constitution. It plays a big role in voting. But also should not be kept because voters vote not for president but for slate of electors.  And also can confuse voters about the candidate and end up voting wrong.

The electoral college system sholud be kept if it help  the people the votes of the electors so they can total up the scores of the votes. And it  consists of 538 electors but only majority of electoral of 270 is requried to elect the president.

An election is told to be held every four year after the first monday in November.

Electoral college system sholud not be kept because its really not a vote. When u go to vote your really not voting for that person you votin for that person slate of electors. So if your not voting for them y vote at all it would make no sense to. These is one reason why it should not be kept.

Another reaason it should not be kept is that it can confuse oyu say (Bradford Plumer) and sometimes people wonder what would might cause the disaster factor We sholud consider our selves lucky  that the 2000 fiasco was the biggest electon crisis in a century  sya (Bradford Plumer).

The electoral college should be kept because it cause less stress on big states than it will on small states. And it helps advoid run off electoral to where not just one candidate get all votes  like nixon and clinton because both only had 43% of plurality majority in the Electoral College.

These are some reasons why electoral college should and shouldn't be kept and should be changed.
