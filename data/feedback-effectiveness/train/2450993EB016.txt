I disagree with the value of using this technology to read students emotional expression because a picture may be susposed to make you laugh but it only shows what the computer can do.

. Only you know how you are feeling inside and whenever somebody says that they use technology to read students emotional expressions they are not accurate .

The Mona Lisa picture is intended to make somebody smile but it only shows what the computer can do . The creater of the picture has made more than one picture . You may not see anything in the picture that shows emotion but there is always something in his paintings . The Mona Lisa picture is 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted , 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry . She has many emotions not just one .

Even thought you may think the Mona Lisa may be boring it does show emotion but it is hard to find . New computer software has been made to inhance the picture .
