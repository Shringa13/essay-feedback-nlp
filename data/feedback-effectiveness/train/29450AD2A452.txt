Dear principal,

I think that kids should be aloud to help kid pick up litter and other things like that to help our community. If the kids at the school do this it shows other people that really don't care that there are some people out there that want a better community. So if we start it can really catch on and the more and more we do it the more it catches on to people. just like all of the drinkers out there that through there bottles or can on the ground or the other ones that cant make it to a garbage can or just didn't want to, care ,or feel like putting it in a garbage can. those are the people that we are trying to get through about this situation. so all kids young and old should be aloud to help the elementary kids with there school work or get some friends and pick up the litter, because there not hurting anyone there helping us and our community.
