Dear State Senator,

To be honest we should not keep the Electoral College because there unfair, outdated, and irrational. There unfair to citizens and the states who vote. In my opinon I think all the electors care about is just the winnings from the presidential candidate. I would like to call the Electoral College the disaster factor. I agree in Mr. Plumber saying. Bradford Plumber said in his writing of The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wong, "In the vein, "faithless" electors have occasionally refused to vote for there party's candiate and caste a deciding vote for whomever they please...." I think there heartless. That's another reason why I don't like them. Now look all they care about is themselves. I pretty sure most of the voters or the states don't know this but did you know when we the voters "vote for the presidental canidate" we're actually voting for a slate of electors? Electoral College lack democratic pedigree, also there practical reason, liberal and conservative reason. What I found out that is also not fair is to the citizens and state who vote, is that the winning candiate's share his share of popular vote with the Electoral College. First of all, we voted for the candiate not for the electoral. We don't know the electoral. Knowing this, we the citizens just might not vote anymore. The electoral is not sharing the presidential house, we choose one person to look up too. Not the greedy electoral. Some states don't even vote anymore because they know that there vote has no effect. It's hard to say this but Bob Dole was right: Abolish the Electoral College!

Sincerely, PROPER_NAME, A citizen of Florida.       Â
