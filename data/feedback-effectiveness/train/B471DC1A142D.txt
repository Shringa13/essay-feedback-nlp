why should we stop driving cars? cars  take us places way faster than we could be riding bick or walking. yes i know cars cause polltuion but we have made more advance cars that run on electricity and it takes where we need to go at the same place and doesnt do harm to the atmo sphere. cars help you ge tot any place faster and if a reallybad accidnent happen and a hospital was too far away how are we goona help them if we cant find a way to get to one as quicly as possible. cars are one of the best transportation devices so why would you try to get rid of them even if they just cause a little daamge to the earth it really isnt that bad. we really need cars for a whole bunch of things like going to any of your families houses that live  and going to a road trip that might be a couple of hours away , so imagine if you didnt have a car, how would you be able to do any of those with out one.

if we didnt have cars to use you wouldnt car sales men and gasoline stations and car repair companies and car was businessesnlose alot of money and make them unemployed and it would be hard for them to look for a job in the disasterous economy of ours and it would make it worse than it already is . honestly to me i think this is outrageous for us to do that. there is no way that we can all just driving cars either we just have to find a better way to fuel up the car without hurtung the enviorment. and when that one day come we would stop this worldwide problem.
