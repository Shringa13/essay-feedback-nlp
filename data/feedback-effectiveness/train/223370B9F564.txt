Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I have been told that you are deciding whether you should give your students community service, well i think you should only give your students community service is if they did something bad. Community service is really for people who have did something bad, but also you can volunteer to do it for your community, just to help your community stay clean and nice. People shouldn't think that doing community service wastes your time because it doesn't, you need to do something positive in life, you should be glad to do something positive. If you're an adult, and you did something bad and you had to go talk to an elementary school, I would tell them not to do what I did because they wouldn't wont to be in situation I'm in, so then they would no not to do bad stuff when they grow to be an adult. I believe that some people don't want to do community service because they think somebody would see them out there, and they would start laughing at them and they'll get mad. It would be good to start community service at a young age, so you will have that care in you throughout your life. TEACHER_NAME, if your students thinks it takes to much time of there day, so be it, I'll let the students that really want to and care about there community.

Sincerely, STUDENT_NAME
