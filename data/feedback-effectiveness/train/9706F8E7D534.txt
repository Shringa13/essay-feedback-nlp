Luke Bomberger was just an ordanery small town boy untill his friend ofered a jod as a seagoing cowboy. When he was thinking about it he said to him self that it would be a wonderfull oprtunet and just couldn't say no. He told his friend that he would take the jod.

When Luke truned 18 thay could have drafted him over to the army but they didn't. Luke claims in the article that he was ment for the job becues he was rased on his aunt's farm. Yet he was not ready for the sea.

Luke said he saw some pritty cool stuff. Thay also had some fun on the ship when the anamals were out. When Luke came home his aunt was probuly rilly thankfull that he came back ok.

He probuly was thankfull that he got to come home becoues the other seagoing cowboys didn't do as much seagoing as him. Luke said going over seas let him be more aware for people and there needs, thats what lead him to latter on hosting international students in his home for many years.
