Luke had just graduated college and his friend Don Reist invited Luke to go to Europe with him. Luke said yes because it was an opportunity of a lifetime and he could not pass it up. Luke became a Seagoing Cowboy.

Luke said, "Being a Seagoing Cowboy he got to see Europe, China and he got to see the Acropolis in Greece." He got to see so many great sites. Luke toured an excaveted castle in crete and he marveled at the Panama Canal on his way to China.

Luke had to travel a lot. But, even though it took two weeks to cross the Atlantic Ocean from the eastern coast of the United states and a month to get to China. On the long journey

Luke stayed busy by taking care of animals. Taking care of animals and traveling was not all Luke did on the boat, the cowboys played lots of games. Some of the games they played was baseball and volleyball games in the empty holds where animals lived. They also did table-tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling and other games to pass time.

Luke said that "being a Seagoing Cowboy was much more than an adventure." For Luke it opened up the world to him. Luke had a lot of fun seeing different sites, meeting new people, playing fun games and caring for people in a different, and better way.
