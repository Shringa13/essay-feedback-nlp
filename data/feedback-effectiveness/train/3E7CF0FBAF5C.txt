Studying venus would be really interesting but venus is hard to study because it´s dangerous and it has really high pressure.

Venus is sometimes known as earth´s twin because venus is the closest planet to earth in terms of density and size. Scientist have tried to get to get numerous spacecrafts on venus but no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours. Venus is one of the hardest planet to study and research. It´s hard for astrounauts to go to venus because temperature is over 800 degrees Fahrenheit and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what humans experience on our own planet.

If NASA sent humans to venus it would be really hard for the astronauts to land because it has hostile conditions on the surface of venus. When the humans would land on venus the air pressure would be close to some of the levels in the sea and the temperature would be toasty.

In conclusion, venus has challenging things it presents and it would make it very hard for people in NASA to put human life on a planet that has very high air pressure and temperature that we are not used having on earth.
