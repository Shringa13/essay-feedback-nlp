Venus sometimes is called the "Evenning Star." Its one of the highest points of light on the sky. Venus is actually a planet and not a star. Venus is the closeest planet to earth such as its density, size, and sometimes distance too. The author states that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents.

One of the things that Venus is dangerous becasue of its thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets the planet. The danger of this is that the clouds are made up of highly corrosive sulfuric acid. The acid can nearly kill you if there is a little bit touching you in any shape or form. Otherwise, Earth surface is on a average of over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the pressure is 90 times that what we have on our planet.

In conclusion Venus is very dangerous for any kind to be on, such as animals or humans. Although the plant is pretty hot its not good to be on it.
