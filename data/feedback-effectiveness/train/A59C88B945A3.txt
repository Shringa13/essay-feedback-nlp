I don't think its Aliens, it has to be the way the land formed its self. My space partner totally disagrees with me, saying that it is aliens. Some people believe in Aliens unlike me. We have not discovered any site of Aliens for a very long time, intill we discovered this face. How could Aliens even do this? Did the Alien just die and sit there for 10,000 years?

It is very possible for landform to make a odd looking face. My space patner thinks that Aliens made the face by dieing and sittig there for s long time. He thinks that they are so smart they made that face to drag humans into Mars. Some Alien maybe had to make a sacrifice? I think that landform and the sun had something to do with it. The sun probably melted some land, or maybe it moved just right to make this face.

The fact that "The Face of Mars" got popular and got out there suprised me. I would be kinda shocked though, if I was someone at home and someone comes and tells me "They descovered a Face on Mars". I would defentely be a little curious. Me and my partner have came to a conclusion that it was landform. That there is still no site of Aliens. That dosen't mean we woun't stop looking.
