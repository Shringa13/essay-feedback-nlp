Dear principal, yes there should because our school is not clean and a lot of students leave there trash and they blame other people. For some other people trash . That's not right that they do that so defenetly . We shold have community service for those student that don't clean up there own mess. I think that is a great idea cause when u put that rule they would start to listen to the school rules. Then they would all see how we need to listen to the school that when they say to clean up is time to clean every body should listen to every thing the principal wants every body to listen to him to what he says to students and also listen to your teachers because that is not fare you don't do the right things.

I think the students would listen to him he is a nice principal.

sincerely, student
