Venus and Earth are very similiar and somtimes Venus is just right around the corner from Earth. The author of "The Challenge of Exploring Venus" supports the idea of studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers because he provides sufficient evidence.

Studying Venus is a worthy pursuit because of the similarities with Earth. The Author explains that "Today, Venus still some features that are analogous to those on Earth" (4). Analogous means the outside has changed but the inside or function are similiar to that pf something else. If Venus still has valleys and mountains similiar to the of Earth then if we studied those features we could find out what happened to Venus decades ago. The Author also states, "Venus can somtimes be our nearest option for a planetary visit" (4). Launching space crafts to other planets is very expensive and even more so for a planet light year away, but if we can send space crafts to Venus when it is closest to us then it will Americans hundreds in tax dollars and we will learn a great deal from Venus.

In conclusion, Venus is worthy to be explored because there is so much we do not know about it yet and we could find something on that planet that we mever thought exsisted before.
