Many people may argue about the advantages of limited car usage. "When i had a car, i was always tense, im much happier this way" (Source 1). Many countries including France, Colombia, and Germany seem to have no problem with limited car usuage.

Germany is one of the greatest countries that is against low car life. 70 percent of Vauban's families do not own cars. 57 percent sold a car to move Germany. (Source 1). In total their is approximatly 5,500 residents and has a low car life because their are less space for parking.

One of the most populated city in France is Paris. Paris enforced a driving ban to clear up the polution. A 22-euro fine was given if one failed to corespond with the rules. Around 4,000 drivers were fined and 27 people had their cars impounded for their reaction to the fine . After 5 days of almost car free roads (not including bus and taxis) the traffic went down by 60 percent.(Source 2). The biggest problem of the smog was Diesel fuel. Diesels make up 67 percent of vehicles in France compared to the rest of Western Europe that has 53.3 percent average on Diesel.

For 3 straight years, Bogota has been doing "Day Without Cars" that limites transportation only allowing buses and taxis. the goal for this day is to reduce smog in the capital city. Violators who failed to corespond was faced with a $25 fines. " Millons of colombians hiked,biked,skated, or took the buses to work during this car-free day" (Source 3). The whole family went to parks and sports centers to occupy their day. Even two others Colombian cities, Cali and Valledupar joined in on this event.

What both countries are trying to do is limited cars so less polution. Their are other transportation besides cars that we can use.
