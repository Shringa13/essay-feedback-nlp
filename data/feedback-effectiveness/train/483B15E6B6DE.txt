Dear Principal,

I don't think it is right for you to change our school policy. Because students you are really good at playing sports should be allowed to play no matter what. Because they really work hard at doing their best to impress the coach and work hard at the sports they love.

I think you should consider the student that have at least one A, B, or C in class to play in school activities and to play school sports. Half the school students get at least a grade average of a "C" so why change if half the school is doing better. the other half is trying to their grades up gut some things get hard for some people. You should let the students play the sports because not all students are going to get a "B" average in school.

Every student should be given a chance in sports. To see what they can do and if there are behaving badly just pull them out of the sport they are playing. and tell them they cant play until next try-outs. And hopefully they will make the team those try-outs.

To be honest I don't like playing sports because I am really bad at sports well some of them i am good but most bad. so you wont be seeing me playing any sports, only the sports i like to play . but you really should let the students who have at least a "c" average to in the sports you say that's aloud to play at the right tome of the year. But i think you should like get the kids who are foot-ball players and form a foot-ball team at our school. For at least two months or one month that would like be so much fun and get cheerleaders to represent our team and school. iam just putting ideas out there for you
