Do you want to hear a story? so i was at work cause im a scientist an me in my friend had an agrument about what happen to mars about the facemark.

The agrument started because we were talking talking about it an he said that a alien put it there i said impossible. So he got mad at me i said state your reason why you think a alien put it there. He responed that he dont know i said you have to know something but then he saw an picture and he said the picture look like alien heads.

Then i gave him my response he said why you don't think it's aliens i told him i don't belive and aliens. He said thats not a good enough reason because i did not state facts so i told him the reason why i dont belive aliens are real beacuse i never heard one i never saw one with my own eyes and i also said the face dont look nothing like a alien. The argument kept going on because he said i dont know what a alien look like so you dont.

Last, we came together an said we dont know cause we kept arguing about how was a alien and how it was not a alien. He did not like my response when i said i dont know how they look how they sound thats why i said it was not a alien. It also kept going cause i did not like his response he did give me details or nothing. He just told me he look up a picture that look like alien thats why we came together and said we don't know.
