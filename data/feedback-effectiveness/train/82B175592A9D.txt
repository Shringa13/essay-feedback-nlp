I think the new Facial Action Coding could be true, because nowadays we have more technology. The 3-D computer model of the face could actually see our face expressions. Maybe it wont actually know what we feel inside like our mood. The Facial Action Coding update can just tell us if we have a annoyed,sad,mad etc face. Sometimes, people seem sad or mad but that's just their thinking or worried face.

If the technology of the Facial Action Coding System was that powerful ir smart to read students emotions, it would be good and cool. Teachers would actually know why there student is quiet or why they're not doing anything in class. My evidence is that " by weighting the different units, the software can even identify mixed emotions (as in da Vinci" masterpiece). Each expression is compared against a neutral face (showing no emotions). if you're really close with a friend or family member you'll know if their upset or not.

You see them everyday you already know how they are. The Facial Action Coding System would just study your face and tell you how you are. Whoever came up with that software and the emotional expressions came out wrong. Then, people wouldn't trust it anymore. When you smile and your cheek bones raise then that a real smile and a showing all your teeth.

Sometimes, when someone is really upset or don't want to be rude they can fake a smile that looks so realist. The software update also could follow is the student is bored or not knowing what to do. We honestly need that in all school. Some kids are always disrespectful or always getting in trouble, never doing work. The Facial Action Coding System would be so much help for everyone. The software update knew about the painting Monsa Lisa face expressions.
