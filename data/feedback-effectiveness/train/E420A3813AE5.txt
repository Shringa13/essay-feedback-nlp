I believe there is life on mars. I believe there is life on mars because of the photos because of the talk around town. On May 24,2001 NASA sent Viking 1 in to outer space but what it found were still trying to figure out could there be life on Mars. The Viking sent back pictures of mars carved into it was a illusion of eyes nose and mouth so let me say again can there be life not just on earth but on Mars the question is still to be answerd. NASA says the have witness alot of things up that we dont know or could even imagin there could be life on every plant and if there is I know we all want to witness it one day. I know I am not the only one who would want to explore through out the box through out the earth but may I say the question is still out there for me for you for the future. So let that be known that you and me and what ever is out there are alike curious to seek and craving for advanture. You and me both will fly out of here hand by hand sister to brother to find whats on mars in the future qustion that is waiting to be answerd will be seen head smelled by the ones who are seeking that adventure to answer that qustion that we all what to know. Is there life on mars.
