Dear TEACHER_NAME, Principal of SCHOOL_NAME

Hello TEACHER_NAME, my name is STUDENT_NAME

and I am a student here at SCHOOL_NAME in El Paso, TX. So TEACHER_NAME I have been tasked on a assignment for an opinion that students should be tasked to do community service at SCHOOL_NAME. So my opinion for students to volunteer for community service at SCHOOL_NAME is that I think students should be tasked for community service rather at a high school than rather a middle school and I have tons of reasons for this event.

One of my reasons is that students would get better advantages of getting community service at a high school rather than getting more disadvantages at a middle school. Another reason is that students that are going to volunteer for community service is that they get more opportunities at doing community service at lets say for example a swimming pool and you could volunteer as a life guard and you can help clean the high ways for litter than just doing community service at your own school rather like middle school you can only do community service only on the school campus rather than doing it someplace else. Another reason is that lets say for example you have to earn 20 hours of community service to pass a high school class and you can do those hours on the school days or the weekend unlike middle school you receive 15 hours of community service and you do it possibly every day but it can mess up study time.

So TEACHER_NAME the reason that you should have students do community service at a high school is because you can socialize, work, and you can meet different people in the process and make them as friends rather than helping the same person that you already know. I hope when you read this TEACHER_NAME I think we could settle this and I can tell you my opinion is no. I hope you can understand this and agree of what I have to say about this event that I am tasked on. Thank you for your time.
