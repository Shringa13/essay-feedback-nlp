Why would there be a face on mars? It could be a computer image hicup.

The land erodes. There are a lot of things that are natural and look like faces.

But, it still might not be natural. No the rock formation is natural.

First off, it could be a computer image hicup. What I mean is That the camera that is moving takes different pictures of one area as its moving. I can relate to another "alien" sighting. A comet passing earth was thought to be a triangular UFO

but the telescope took three different pictures at once and gave it that UFO shape.

Secondly, The land erodes over time. The land could have eroded land could cause a "face" to appear. This "face" is nothing more than a simple act of nature and its way. In the top picture over time you can see it erode away, especialy the 1998 photgraph.

Thirdly, We see things that look like faces everyday, wether its clouds or land formations. We see our faces everyday, so its easy to compare. In the top picture you can see a land formation, but scince we know what a face looks like its easy to compare to. In the picture, yes we can see some definition but its still just a land form. For example the man in the moon, it looked like a face but wasn't.

On the other hand, it might be. Most theorists claim it appears to be an Egyptian Pharoh. The theorists also claim that the martians built the pyramids. It's a theory but it might be possible.

In conclusion, No it is a natural landform. It could be a computer image hicup.

The land erodes. There are a lot of things that are natural and look like faces.

But, it still might not be natural. If it is unnatural then there could be other life out there.
