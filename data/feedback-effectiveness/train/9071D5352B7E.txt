It would be unfair to disregard this opportunity from civilians as the right to vote and not give them the chance to prove themselves on whats right for them. This actually improves presidential votes,meaning that electors are recommended to do the responsibilities that the state laws vary. It improves the presidential election and taking it away will cause chaos among electors and presidential candidates. As stated in source three, paragraph one ,"The advocates of this position are correct in arguing that the Electoral college method is not democratic in a modern sense ... it is the electors who elect the president, not the people." The meaning in this is that people vote for the people who vote people. I see no reason to take away this oppportunity though people are still voting in favor of getting the presidential candidate oneself voted for.

In my point of view i see no reason why you would cancel something without a reason in mind. The states depend on the electors to help out the president during president elections. Civilians demand to take charge on whats right for them or what will be in charge of them throughout the next four years. "Voters in presidential elections are people who want to express a political preference rather than people who think that a single vote may decide an election....", said richard A. posner in source three.

Though the senator may be right about one thing, some electors become opponents to the presidential candidates and oppose or defy the will of people. The electors will refuse to vote for their party's candidate and cast a deciding vote or whomever they please, as stated in source two paragraph 11.

I on the other hand depend on electoral college to proceed and do as they please because they have the right to vote for whomever they please.
