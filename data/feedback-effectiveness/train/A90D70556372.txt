Do you think that a new technology called Facial Action Coding System an enables computer to identifyhuman emotions can tell your emotion.? I think that its true because you can look at someone and tell how they're feeling.

In my mind i think i can tell how a person is feeling. If it happy, sad man depressed, or even just trying to hid it. Even your friends and family . For example in the article it says " In fact, we humans perform this same impressive " calculation" every da. for instance, you can oribably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face. Of cours, most of us would hve trouble actually describing ech facil trait that conveys happy, worried, etc."

So yes i think that this technology can tell emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable. some students get bored easy and with technology like this it could helo that from happening.
