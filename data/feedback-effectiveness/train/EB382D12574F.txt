DO YOU HAVE PROBLEMS WITH THE PRESIDENTIAL VOTE?

At long on the History, There's strange and curios case in the story of the political, especialy in United State of America (U.S.A) The political allways had serius problems, like corruption, the confusion of what president choose, the bad counting vote, etc. But with all those problems that happens in the world.. How United States choose good presidents? First, we are going to talk about the curius case in the U.S.A talking about the political and how U.S.A choose the future president.

There's alot of curios case in the U.S.A. For example, it's said clearly in the article that for first time in the story of U.S.A there's 2 represents to be president that came from the state of Hawaii in 1960, and those represent was against Jhon F. Kennedy. Or the other case that the Electoral system in those times it was very confused and for each state it represents 1 vote so The legendary John Kerry wins 34 democratics votes. There was alot of controversy.

But with all those problems, how those U.S.A choose good there presidents? The goverment like there citizen have clearly 5 things (according the article wrote by Richard A. Posner) That are: ''Certainty of Outcome'' That is selecting a president that ougth to be who most votes receives is the winner. ''Everyone's President'' Means that is a resulr by a candidate with only regional appeal is unlikely to be a successful president.''Swing State'' Is a method of awarding electoral votes induces the candidates.''Big States'' Is a large state that gets more attention from presidentail candidates in a campaign than small state does.. And the last one is ''Avoid Run'off Elections'' That it could be argued method selecting the president may turn off by potential voters.

In my opinion, i'm pro with. Is a very nice Goverment and Can helps every country in the world becouse there potential economic that they have.
