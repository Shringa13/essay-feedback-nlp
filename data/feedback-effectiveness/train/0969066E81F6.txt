Dear senator,

I think we should keep our Electoral College because its fair if we get to choose our president and he or she wins then he or she should be president. Some people should consider themselves lucky because of what happened in 2000 with that fiasco and it was the biggest election crisis in a century. Even though there is 270 votes required to vote for the president, whats fun about that is because there be more  votes and atleast people participate in them. Choosing our president is best because when your voting for the president your voting for state electors. Also, it gives chances for people that want to be president or senator. Electoral college is not a place its a process that it lets people choose who they want in the white house. I think people should start taking things seriously because they might think its a joke but its real serious to other people. Under the 23rd Amendent of the constitution,"the District of Columbia is allocated 3 electors and treated like a state for the purpose of the Electoral College." After the presidential election,our governor prepares a "certificate of ascertainment" listing all the people who ran for president. It also gives them a chance to show and see who would do more for our country,like for example when they do their campaign commercials and what i look at is who does the best. Thats what i think about if it should be changed or not. Thank you for reading my letter and i hope my letter changes your mind.
