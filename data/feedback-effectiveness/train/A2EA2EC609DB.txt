Some people say the face on mars was an alien artifac, but others think its just a natural landform. With supporting details from the article, I will assure you that it was just a natural landform.

In paragraph seven, it states that the first picture to come out on a website (JPL) was a natural landform picture. It also says that there was no alien monument after all. If you actually read the article it says that the face is made of shadows. If you put it at a different angle then I bet there wouldn't be a face, there would just be bumps on the planet mars like any other planet. In paragraph twelve, the writer tells us that the picture shows the Martian equivalent of a butte or messa. Those landforms are common around the American West. Lastly, aliens aren't real so how could something unreal make a face on mars?

I know some people might want to belive that it was aliens, but it wasn't. Sometimes the earth/nature makes its own natural landforms, and we have to love it for what it created, not give all the credit to some unreal creature.
