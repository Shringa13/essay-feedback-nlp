I think that the new technology to read students faces in the class room could be of some use, but I also think that it would not be of use in the classroom. The reason I think it would be useful is it could help a teacher understand some of the kids facial expressions.

A teacher can read the childs face to see if they can help then when they are sad and dont tell anyone, but I also think that it would be an invasion of the childs space, because sometimes when kids or even adults get mad or sad and they dont say anything to anyone it's because they dont want people to know. It could help in somecases like when a child is being bulllied at school and they dont tell someone then the teacher could use the device to see that the child is either sad or mad or even both.

I support and do not support this at ther same time. i support it because I feel it could be helpful but I do not suppot this because I feel if a child needs help with how they are feeling they will go to an adult they trust, weather it be a teacher at school or a parent or even a friend at achool.
