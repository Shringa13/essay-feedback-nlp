Some peope think that the landform was created by alien's, but have no evidence. You can clearly see in the picture that theres a shadow on the landform. People have even proved that it was a shadow on the landform. You can also conclude that there are no alien's roaming around in space making face's on landform's.

People have no evidence that there are alien's roaming around in space. Alien's are only in the movie's that you see, that's only my opinion though. Even if there were alien's out there, we should have found them by now. With all our space gadget's that we have that can look deep into space, i'm pretty sure we would have found alien's by now.

Even though people have "spotted" alien UFO's, they have no proof. People could have said they even spotted it, but then again since their on video, they could have photoshopped it. People can believe what they want to believe, but if you can see there's perfect evidence, you can't really argue if they have real proof.
