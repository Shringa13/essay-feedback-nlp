Dear principle, i have heard of the policies that you are choosing and i want to tell you that you should choose policy 1. Because we need cell phones in school for emergencies like ''mom i just got accepted to a concert in band'' or ''mom there is a crazy guy in school and we are in lock down I'll call you back when you can come pick me up'' see stuff like that. and yes there are some kids that do use them during class but you can just simply make a rule that if you do use them in class you will have to buy a new one or something. also we can use the sell phones to see why a friend is missing class or that the homework was page 65 in the text book there are all kinds of reasons on why we need to bring cell phones in school not to text your friends but to call for emergencies you never know what might happen in school love a hard working student
