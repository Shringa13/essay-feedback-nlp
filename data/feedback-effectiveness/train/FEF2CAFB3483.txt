In this article " unmasking the face on mars" they are showing us a picture that was taken by a 1976 viking 1 photograph of the face on mars which is just a natural landform. In paragraph 2 scientists firgured it was just another martian mesa, which they state is common around cydonia. Another detail from paragraph 2 they state only because it had unusual shadows that made it look like an egyptian pharaoh.

In the Paragraph 3 it states "huge rock formation which resembles a human head formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes,nose, and mouth." Which means that it's just a illusion it wasn't acutually seen or proven to be a human head.

Another fact which is from paragraph 7 it states Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia and snapped about ten photos and it revealed a natural landform. In paragraph 9 garvin who is in the Mars Global Surveyor is a mapping spacecraft he states "It's not easy to targey cydonia." which means that they just can fly over cydonia and spot it right away.

Finally in paragraph 12 garvin states what the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa- landforms common around the American West. In this article "Unmasking The Face On Mars" it's just a unproven theory that its a face on mars, there is many details in this article that state that it's just a natural landforms.
