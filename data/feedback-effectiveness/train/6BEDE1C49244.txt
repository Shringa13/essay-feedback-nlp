Dear TEACHER_NAME

Dear TEACHER_NAME this is about the policy you are trying to change about you haft to have a b average to play sports.

I don't think it is right that you need to have a b average because some people cant mentally and fiskley do it .

Do think u it should be a regiment to all grades passing with a seventy or above.

Sometime out can not get your grades all up to passing in time. also i am not good at school but i still try.

I think i should get the right to play sport because sports can be job when you get older and it will also keep you in shape just not that but aliened.

So based on behavior i think they could not be able to play but just not because of bad grades.

So i was wondering if you would considered not letting theses kids play sports because the don't have a bee average. If you could just could get back to me at EMAIL_NAME or PHONE_NUMBER.
