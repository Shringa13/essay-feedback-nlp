So "The Challenge of Exploring Venus" is a great little short story that includes very interesting facts and it's all on how to go about studying the planet Venus despite the dangers. That's not even half of it either in other words let me give you some knowledge that I have gained from this wonderul author.

And this is where I'll tell you about the why scientists are still discussing further visits to the planet, so it say's in "The Challenge of Exploring Venus" that it once long ago may have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system then also Venus still today has a surface of rocky sediment besides that includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters fun fact Venus is called our "Sister Planet".

Now let's go to some of the reason's why human-beings aren't able to survive on Venus basically the story say's venus average temperatures are on average eight-hundred fahrenheit,the atomspheric pressure is also 90 times greater than what we experience from here on earth there for as you can see the conditions are too extreme for humans to survive on the planet.

Furthermore let's talk about how NASA plans to study Venus. So NASA's solution is like imagin a bimp-like vehicle hovering thirty-plus miles above Venus to avoid the unfriendly ground conditions by staying up there, but it doesn't mean it's not going to hot it will be around 170 degrees Fahrenheit and thje air pressure would be close to that of sea level on Earth.

Finally for this conclusion I will just voice my own opinon about the short story on "The Challenge of Exploring Venus" the thing I liked about the story is that it wasn't that hard to break everything down in to a little essay but besides that it was good and very informational story. I loved it!
