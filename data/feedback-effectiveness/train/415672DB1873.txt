Dear TEACHER_NAME,

The policy you have are very nice. i agree with both policy but if i have 2 chose it will be policy # 1. all though cells phone distract students from the work in class room and many other reason i would really perfume we do have our cells phone in school. and i am not just saying this b. cause i am a teenage and i am a student in SCHOOL_NAME

i am saying this b. cause we have all day with our phone. while we are in our classes they will be off like policy # 1 said in the first sentence "Allow students to bring phones to school". in the 2 sentences "as long as the phones are turned off during class". i know for a fact kids may disobey this rule but it dose not hurt 2 TRY. but if the student phone continues 2 turn on and off there is a possibility the phone will get messed up by turning on and off . if there was an other policy i would have 2 say put our phones on lock or sleep or when we attend our class we put them in a box and when class is over we will get them back. but like i said i agree with both policy. A lot or students may agree with this policy just b. cause it have has 2 involve cells phones and we just want 2 use them cells phone are good in some ways 2 bring them 2 school and in other ways they are not every body has there own opinion.

Thank you STUDENT_NAME
