Cars have been producing smog and causing problems with countries. Therefor countries such as France,Germany,and Bogota have been making national days where vehicles are not allowed to be driven to reduce smog that diesel engines produce. This international day in these countries have enforced the use and caused a 25$ fine to must users prices can range. Also scientists in the U.S have started to notice the decline in vehicles bought,after all America was the maker of the first vehicle the "Model T".

But in France the smog was getting as bad as China and Beijing. France was one of the worst countries for smog out of most European capitals it was compared with Brussels and London and its numbers toppled them over with one hundred and forty seven micrograms unlike Brussels with one hundred and fourteen and London with seventy nine point seven. Delivery companies were complaining of the lost revenue. While there were some exceptions made for some plug in cars which had capabilities of carrying three or more passengers public transit was free of charge Friday through Monday.

In the country Columbia cities such as Cali and Valledupar have taken work in the event to reduce smog people were riding bikes and even if it rained they really didn't mind it. This event has reduced rush-hour traffic sidewalks refurbished with smoother ones, new restaurants,and even new upscale shopping districts.

The shifts of car business in America have gotten car dealerships to worry about how many people are buying cars from dealerships due to the fact there's hybrid vehicles coming out which  lowers the use of gas and pollution on most vehicles such as the prius. There has been studies to show that young people that drive have decreased by Twenty three percent. Also another reason is that kids are able to carpool with friends or take local transport such as buses or taxis which limit the needs for a car.
