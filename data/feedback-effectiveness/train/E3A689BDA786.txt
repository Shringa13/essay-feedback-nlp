Dear State Senator,being apart of the voting process is extremely important.It's important,because you are helping by popular vote for the president of the United States.Electoral College helps you get a better understanding of the voting process and the effect that everyone's vote has.However,the Electoral colleges are not a really big help when it comes down to the country.Here is provided information about why they should change election by popular vote.

First to start the discussion,Electoral Colleges were estblished by the founding fathers in the constitution as a compromise between election of the president by vote in congress and election of the president by popular vote.The Electoral College is not just a place it's an important process.This college is made of electors.They have meetings where they vote for the president and vice president.The college is consisted of 538 electors.At least 270 electoral votes are required to elect the president.Each candidate that is interested in becoming president in your state has to have his or her own flock of electores.The electors are chosen by the political party ran by the candidate.This college basically provides you with a idea of why it is important to vote. The country's fate rests in the hands of many.

Next,The Electoral college system only allows voters to vote for the slate electors. The president of the United States votes is more important then the slate electors.The president of the United States is the one responsible for the Country.Most people refer to the most common argument between the electoral college as the disater factor.Like for instance if someone wanted to vote for a specific person you would have to vote for a different amount of slate electors also depending where you lived as well.

Continuing,the Electoral college is really regarded as an anachronism aslo known as a non-democratic method of selecting a president. Many people believe that,that should be overruled by declaring the candidate who recieves more popular votes is the winner.Each party selects a slates of electors that is trusted to vote for the nominee that was picked slate electors.Even though the Electoral has a lack of conservative reasons, there are five reasons that people think that should be retained. The first reason is the certainy of outcome,second Everyone's President,third Swing states,fourth Big States,and lastly Avoiding run-off Elections.These 5 things are reasons why people feel that these colleges should stay.

The conclusion, the president of the United states is chosen by our votes.We have the power to make this country strong,but we also have the power to make this country a train wreck.Voting is really important this can determine the fate of the country.
