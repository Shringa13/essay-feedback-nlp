Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I disagree because, one all most every kid loves their sports if its watching it or doing it.

And second of all not every kid is as smart as a B or better average grade some can only get a C- or better. I know im only as smart as a C- average. So i say they should only have to keep there grades up at a C- or better to play any sport. Well look at them all most every kid has a C average so why not let them have a C average and be able to play in sports or other activities. If they have a B average then that's great but if they have at least a C average then that's good to, so don't you think we should be able to play sports or other activities if we have C` s? If everyone had B `s then we all would be as smart as each other and most likely get the same points on a test like everyone else, then the teachers would question if we cheated or not even though we didn't we just new the correct anwsers.

sincerely, your friend
