In my opinion I think that the author did a great job on sjowing the dangers of venus beause he gave a lot of information. He also tells us about the name that they give venus and the way that they describe the planet. Now that I have read the passage I now know that venbus is a very dangerous planet to explore.

In the passage the author states that Venus was the closest planet to earth. Venus was to the closest to the size and distance of the earth. It was often called earths twin. Venus was also called the Evening Star,but that nickname was very misleading since it was actually a planet. Venus is also one of the most easiest planet to spot if you are standing on earth. Although venus was the closest to the planet The author also started to notice that Mars was close to earth also. Then he started noticing that sometimes Venus was closer to Mars and sometimes Mars was closer to Earth then Venus.

Venus hasnt been explored since it is way to dangerous to be explored. They would send ships that are unmanned,because when ever they would send people that were inside the paceship they would not survive the landing. That is the main reason why they havent landed there or try to land there in three decades. A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent of carbon dioxide covers Venus. The passage states that "Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfic acid in venus Atmosphere. On the planets surface,temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit,And the Atmoshperic pressure is 90 times more greater then what we experience on our own planet".

Astronomers are saying that Venus may have once been been a planet like earth. I think that he did a really good job on collenting information abou venus .i hope that one day Astronomers will be able to land on Venus safely and be able to explore it. The reason is because I wonder what it is like to be on that planet. In my opinion I think that one day it will be possible to explore Venus.
