I think that students ought to have there vote in the situation because why would you make people do something they don't want to do. I also think that they should help in some way because the more people that help the more productive and fun it will be. You can also split the people that are helping into different groups to cover places more in the region. The more we help at a young age the more we will do it through out our lives. Helping the community is the most important thing next to a education and we should all want to be a part of it no matter how young or old you are. The more that we can help our community the stronger it may become because people will invite friends to help. So i think that you should make them do it but to make it more fun to make them want to come and invite friends to help.
