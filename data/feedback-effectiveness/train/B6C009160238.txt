Dear State Senator,

I understand that there have been some issues regarding whether or not to keep the Electoral college or to change the system to a more simple- election by popular vote. From my understanding, the Electoral College has worked for many years with no issues or roadblocks so to speak that have interfered or had a bias on these decisions. But, from my recent discovery it might not be as well thought out and fair as we thought.

I was just informed that i'm not really voting for the president, i am voting for the official voter that will then, in turn vote for the president(Using their own biases). Since i was not aware of this, i am quite shocked. I'm assuming that this is just something that gets passed by or not looked at very deeply, but i willbe that person that digs down and gets all up in the business of somone other than myself.

This is offical: The electoral colllege is unfair, oudated and irrational. The best arguments in favor of it are mostly assertions without a basis in reality. Yes, The electoral college does avoid the problem of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast but, either way the method of selecting the president may turn off potential voters for a candidate who has no hope of carrying their state anyways.

Thank you for your time,
