In my opinion i feel like the use of technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is not valuable. I think its not a good idea of technology reading our emotions. Some people do have hard time showing their feelings but its either because they are hurt or scared. Others just show their feelings and emotions. Those are the kind of people that have been hurt but still move on with their lifes. Might take them a couple of days, weeks, months or maybe even years. This generation has changed there is a lot of technology now days. Us as humans we do what we like and work on what we like to do he express our emotions on what we do.

On the other hand using technology is kind of a good idea for people that have trouble showing their feelings and emotions are the kind of people that would us technology. These kind of people that are scared to show their emotions would get this so they could get a little help to try to show their emotions. But for another reason the same people that have hard time showing their emotions are the one who would probably not use technology.

For example using technology to show the Mone Lisa painting emotions would be 83 percent happy, 9 percent disguste, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry. All of that doesnt sound right why not just express what you feel your emotions, Just be yourselfs.

On the other hand another reason why people are scared to show their emotions and feelings is because the care about what other people think about them. That is one thing people should not care about do whatever makes you happy making good decisions. But happy is what everyone needs to be we only live once and why not spend it with the ones we love and that make us happy,
