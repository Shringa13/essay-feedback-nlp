Dear, Senator

Let the people vote for the person they want to not the electoral collage. I agree that the electoral collage should be change. This is because some people vote for a president that they are not voting for. People wish that the person that they are voting should be president. Yes we should follow the constitutuion but something we should not follow at all. On paragragh 10 it says that when you vote you don't vote for the president you vote for the slate of electors. Then they pick who should be the president. People have the chance to vote for who should be the president. For,example, when something happen in 2000 gore and bush. Gore had the upper hand and was going to will but then instead of gore winning bush on.

The electoral collage is good but not that good. The electoral collage has to choose the president and the vice president. That is not right. many people thought that the U.S is doing the right thing but they are not. During this time in 2000 campaign,17 states did not see the candinates at all. if anyone has a good arguement for putting the fate of predsidencey in the hand of a few swing vater in ohio they have not taken there move yet. the electoral collage is unfair, outdated, and irrational. the best argument in fovor of it are mostly assertion without much basis. mr. ob dole was right that we should abolish the electoral collage. i beleive and it my oppion that this is not right but the candinates think so.

Like On paragragh 18 the same thing happen with obama and romney to . obama received 61.7% for the elector vote compared to only51.3%.so the electoral collage should not be a constitution because that if we let it keep on going then is will not be fair to anyone at all. And it also not fair for a winner tom take all.       Â
