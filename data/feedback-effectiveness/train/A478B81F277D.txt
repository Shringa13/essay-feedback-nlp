DEAR

state senator i am writing this letter to argue in favor of keeping the electoral college and changing to election by polulor vote for the president of the united states. I beleve that we should keep it because peolpe and citizens have the right to vote for who they think would be a good leader for ower counrty.

I think that we should keep it like this because if we dont have enugh peolple to vote there may be a 100% that there will be a tie. Like in 1976 there was a tie if a mere 5,559 voters in ohio and 3,687 voters in hawaii had voted the other way there wouldnt have been a tie. I do know that under the electoral college system, voters vote for the president ,but for a slate of electors ,who in turn elect the president. I also know that the peolpe who pick the electors in the firs place depend on the state.

In conclution , i would like to make this argue because i think that we should be the ones that get the chance to vote for some one that i think we enough trust in please i hope that you understand the reason to why i am arguing in favor of keeping the electoral college and changing to election by populor vote for the president of the united states . thank you very much for receving my letter have a good day sincearly:
