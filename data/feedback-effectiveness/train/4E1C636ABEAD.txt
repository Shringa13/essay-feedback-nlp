PROPER_NAME

People should not be able to use cell phones while operating a vehicle.

There are several reasons why and I will be discussing two of them. Cell phones are a convience to our society, but there should be a time and place for them to be used.

First, cell phones are a benefit and allows everyone to have access to a telephone at all times of the day.

Kids, teenagers, adults, even grandparents have cell phones.

As you pay attention to people that you pass by whether it's in traffic or walking, there is a cell phone in toat.

While riding a bike, people are on the phone.

While driving cars, people are on the phone.

While sitting waiting for a bus, people are on the phone.

Even while people are walking they are on the phone.

Do they get any break?

The phone that is?

With all of this phone use where is the focus of the individual?

Individual focus does not exist when everyone is on their cell phone.

Whether they are looking at the weather, SnapChat, Facebook, or Instagram, they are still not focused on their surroundings.

With the lack of focus there have been more accidents and deaths.

Accidents occur when you are distracted and death can easily follow.

While driving the attention needs to be on the road.

There have been documentaries where those that have lost loved ones due to inappropriate cell phone use read the last message that was sent or the last words that they user said.

Many times that call or message wasn't that important and could have waited.

Overall, individuals should not use cell phones while driving.

They cause distraction and lack of focus.

Many lives could be saved if people weren't careful about their cell phone usage.
