I am not against the vaule of using this technology to read students emotional expressions. I am not against it because it is cool and something different. Also the fact knowing a computer can read your emotions is kinda cool. "if you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow."

I think that they should not change their current screen to a different screen. I say it should not because maybe that person is bored or confused. But you never know if that person is doing something they have to be looking at or working on. For example say i am playing a game. But i have to do a review over the game fro a project. That probably would make me frustrated because the computer think im bored or confused and have an ad appear.

Again, I am not agaist the idea of using this technology to read students emotional expressions. "A clasroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored." It is acually cool to know that a computer know how you feel. Once again i do not feel like a computer should change the screen just because they see you not happy.
