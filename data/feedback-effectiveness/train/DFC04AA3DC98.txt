The Challange of Exploring Venus is the name of this article that I have just read. The author of this article seems to be in full support of pursuing the dangerous planet, but why thats what I'm here to tell you.

First I'll begin with a description of some of the harshness of the planet. "A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus. Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venu's atmosphere." That is a description of the air and sky of Venus, now I will give a description of the surface of Venus. "On the planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 time greater than what we experience on our own planet." Those are some harsh conditions. The author seems to be with the idea of exploring Venus. There are some very interesting things that the author brings up such as "a vehicle hovering over Venus would avoid the unfriendly ground conditions by staying up and out of their way." this seems to prove that it could be possible but what about power, the temperature, and air pressure well the author also included that. "At thirty-plus miles above the surface, the temperatures would still be toasty at around 170 degrees farenheit, but the air pressure would be close to that of sea level on Earth. Solar power would be plentiful." So then what about the danger of radiation well it turns out that that is also brought up. "Radiation would not exceed Earth levels. Not easy conditions, but survivable for humans." so that explains almost all the troubles of this trip and exploration, but there won't be much to see through all the clouds and the fact that going to the ground is too dangerous what could you possibly do. The author seems to support the idea of studying Venus really well, but I don't think that we know enough about the planet to determine whether going is in our best interest.
