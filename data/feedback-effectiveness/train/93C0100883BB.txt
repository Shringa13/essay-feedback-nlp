dear principal,

Policy 1 is a great idea cause students would be able response to there messages during lunch time and will also be able to use it when they have free time in class. As long as we get to use them when we have free it would be ok for them cause every student usually there cell phone when they are finished with there work or are just very bored.

Lunch time is also a great time for students 2 use there cell phones cause they aren't doing any work just relaxing with friends and eat talking also catching up with old friends so at that time they can also use there cell phones.

Students now a days think its cool to be carrying a cell phone so of course they're gonna be showing it to there friends or giving each other numbers. Usually they be showing and using them in class when teachers are giving directions and cause of the rules it sometimes gets more tempted to use your self phone. So if you change the rules there's a probability that students mite be using there cell phones at time when teachers aren't giving directions or at times when they have to finish there work before they do anything else.

sincerely, your students
