Dear; state senator

It states that keeping the electoral college is a more promising way to vote for the president of the united states. If they change it to election by popular vote then it probably wont be fair. Just like in 1960 when they send two slates of electors to congress but that was probably because they had the popular vote and not the elertoral college.

The electoral college is a process,not a place people might have thought that is what place like maybe a college [school]. The thing is who ever thought that was wrong beacuse it was found by the father established it in the constitution as a compromise. Its a long story lets just cut to the chase the electoral college conists of 538 electors a majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect president. On the other had the thind is if you elect your president by the popular then the required number will be higher and possible wont have a president because they will never finsh counting the votes.

Electoral college is the best way to go beacuse like that will only have one slate of electors. But if the popular vote then most likely will end up with two or more slates of electors and personlitly I wouldnt like that. It would be better just to stick with the electoral college so people and the congress wouldnt have to go through so much work just to pick a president.

Look also if the popular vote that doesnt mean that they will win most likely they will lose the predidency for example Al Gore won the popular vote but lost the presidency over 60 percent of the voters. See having theÂ  popular vote wouldnt be the best thing to do. Just stay with the electoral college dont make it so hard on people.
