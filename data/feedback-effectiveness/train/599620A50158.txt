Dear Principle,

I believe Policy 2 would be a better decision. I think it would be a better decision because then students would not be distracted my phone calls and text messages. Choosing Policy 2 may also increase a students ability in school. They may test higher and have better grades. Also, students can get a better job due to their grades.

Students may be distracted by phone calls and text messages because they may not turn off their phone or they bring it to school in the first place. The students may even have their phone on ring which may distract their fellow class mates or even the teacher.

Students also may be distracted from their phones when it comes time for learning. If we take phones out completely the students may get better grades and test higher. They can even get into a better college than what they would have if they were on their phones all the time. That leads to a good job to support their lives and, if they have a family, their families lives.

They may not be aware of this, partly because they may be on their phones, but they can get better jobs if they stay off their phones and on the books. They would not only get better jobs but they even can be paid more than what they would have if they wouldn't have gotten better grades.

The consequences should be very big for being on a cell phone or let alone bringing a cell phone to school. Students should at least have a detention or even an in school suspension. Students need to know their boundaries and what happens when they cross them. Discipline is a great way to turn students off their cell phones.

Cell phones are huge distractions in school. They lead to high school drop outs because of their grades and, not to mention, they lead to low income. If we let students use cell phones more in school they may get the thought they can do whatever they want. We need to put a stop to this now so our future generations will be able to support their families.

Sincerely,
