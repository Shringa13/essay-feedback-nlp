Dear Principal,

Due to the fact that we live in America, where we have the choice of choosing what we would like to do, (most of the time), I due believe that students should have the right to choose weather or not they want to participate in community service. I do, however, want to sate the fact that if we do choose to do community service that our world would be a much better place. I don't, however, believe in forcing people to do something they don't have to do.

On the other hand. if we do community service, we would get jobs done much faster. For example, lets say we helped out at the pound and the it was overflowing with dogs. If we helped out the people, it wouldn't only be a nice thing to do, but you could get some benefits as well. Maybe they'd offer you a job or you may just feel good about helping your fellow community members.

Another example is cleaning up trash on the highway, or anywhere really. That trash will add up and become a huge heap of trash. It's not healthy for you. the plants, or the animals. just imagine what could happen if a small animal ate something that was toxic to them. That wouldn't be good at all.

So just keep in mind that community service is a great thing to do, but if some people don't want to, you shouldn't force them.
