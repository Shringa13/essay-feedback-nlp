A danger of ecploring Venus is that the temperature is very high that hummans might not handle, and has the hottest surface. "On the planets surface, temperatures verage over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet."

I think that we should explore Venus because we should be able to know all of our solar system, but it will be challenging, because of the temperatures, and the pressure.

I like the idea of a havor craft to avoide the hot surface. "a vehicle hovering over Venus would avoid the unfriendly ground conditions by staying up and out of their way."

The only bad thing would be is that what if the hover craft breaks down then they would crash, we dont even know if Venus has spitting lava of the ground. Another example of why exploring Venus is a good idea, is that we can discover new speiceys or materials, mabye even find if there were ancient life on Venus.

I think that exploring Venus would become hisory, because I think that Venus is dangerus place like the temperature, the surface, and even more dangeruse things on that planet that we dont know of or visios speices.
