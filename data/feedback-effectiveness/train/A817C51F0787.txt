There are many things up in Mars. Some , well many, that we do not even know about. Now many believe the face on Mars was created my aliens. But, how could it be so? Well, because it was not.

First of all how could have the aliens created an artifact. How they create it as a form of a face. It's not like aliens just have tools laying around and they sculpt when they are bored. It started to form over the years. The way it was forming and the shadows around it just made it look more of a face.

With all honesty do you not think if NASA was 100% sure this "face" was created by aliens they would've announced it? That would have been big proof that aliens do exist. After all scientists have been trying to look for any other life on other planets for over the years. So that just says NASA also sees it as just a natrual landform.

The face on Mars is became very popular. But not in the scientist type way. It has become a pop icon. It has starred in a Hollywood film,appeared in books, magazines,radio talk shows, even haunted grocery store checkout likes for 25 years. Peopl seem to find it interesting since they are talking and mentioning it alot. I am thinking they just seem to find it interesting that aliens might have created it.

I think it is safe to say that the face on Mars is just a natrual landform. NASA thinks that, so maybe we shoud too. After all they are scientist and part of NASA that knows all this. Later on I know that they will fnd other thing more evidence. People might have something new to believe.
