Dear State Senator,

I think that you should keep the Electoral College because people want to vote for who they want as president. People dont just want to have anybody as president they want to have someone that they thinks knows what they are doing, they want to vote for that person to become president. They vote for the slate of electors who in turn elect the president. You should keep this going because when I get older I want to vote and im pretty shore that theres other people who want to vote when they get older to. You should keep the Electoral College going. Another reason is we want to have a president that we can trust. We just want to vote for who we want to. We just dont want anybody to be president. The Electoral College is a non-democratic method so there may be know reason we should shut it down. Please dont shut the Electoral College down, you should keep it going and not ever shut it down. Everything else about the Electoral College is good. This is my letter of why we should keep the Electoral College going and I hope that it will keep going.

Sinceraly, Kevon
