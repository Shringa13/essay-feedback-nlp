Dear Principal,

As a student of SCHOOL_NAME, I disagree to have the new policy that students may not participate in sports or any other activities unless they have at least a B average grade. I disagree with this policy, because I think that many students work hard to get at least a B average, and maybe if the really love a sport and want to play in it then we should be fare and let them play. Because then I think it wouldn't be fare if a student is just one or two points away from a B average and then not let them play, just because of one low grade or two points off. So then if there are only a little bit of students with a B average then there would be no teams or sports because all of the kids would not be eligible, also in the school activities there wouldn't be many kids there so it wouldn't make the activities as fun. Although I do agree with you that if they do not have good grades and if they have to many U' s then they should not be eligible to play. Therefore if they really loved sports and wanted to play in them, then they would try to raise their grade for it. So I disagree about putting and changing this to become a school policy.

Sincerely, STUDENT_NAME
