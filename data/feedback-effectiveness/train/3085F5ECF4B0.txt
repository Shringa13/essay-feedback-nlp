The author claims that no matter the dangers that venus should still be explored. i agree becuse it is a neighoring planet as well as earths twin and could have been inhabitable a very llong time ago meaning lifeforms could have been living their or still live on venus.

venus is high radiated and very hot their atmospheric pressure is high. The thought of any person wanting to go their is dispicable because of such harsh conditions. But the author does think that venus should be explored dispite the conditions . doing so will take alot of tech we dont have yet but mechanical mechines can be used be cause they are not electrical like computers or smartphones. NASA feels that the best way to explore venus is to hover over it but in order to actually explore said planet you must get close and collect samples thhis will provide evidence for what was missed in the earlier times we tried to explore venus. Along with it being our neighboring planet is has alot of similarities such as size and shape. But also differences such as the planet being almost 800 degrees fahrenheit. The presure could be so strong it can crush submarines that are able to go to the deepest parts of the ocean could be liquefyed. venus a very intresting planet to explore so maybe one day we will be able to visit tis place and search for samples and look for unkown elements.

It is sutable to assume that NASA will still try to explore venus. And figure if their is a way to explore it and venture to et samples and find eelements and reduce the dangers in venus.
