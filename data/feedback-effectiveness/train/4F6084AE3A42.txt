I think that keeping electoral college would be a great idea for many reasons, we have had the electoral college for many years now and it has been great it has many good benifits to it. but many people are against it they believe there vocies aren't  being heard but it is just be revised by that people that know what is best for the country.

One of the reasons the electoral college must stay is that the will be a certainty of the outcomes, they will know exacty what will be coming out as a result instead of being uncertain for example(source 1) Obama recived 6.1 percent from the electoral vote and 51.3 percent for the poplar votes. It was an uncertain vote because the college don't know what the people would pick as a result. but many people think that it should be like that because they are voting for a slate of elector and not for president.(sourse 2)

Another good reason why the elctoral college is a good idea is that it balances the state votes. The states that are larger such as Texas and california have a much larger population so the votes would be larger but the electoral college balances out and the smaller states such as new jersey and main have a small population so the votes wold be smaller. The larger states get more attention from the presidential candidates than the smaller states, so the electoral college balences it out.(sourse 3)

Also the electoral college avoids run-off elections. The electoral college give more for a cleary response, for example,(sourse 3) nixon in 1968 and clinton both had 43 percent plurlity of popular votes but the electoral votes gave them a more accurate result of 301 nixon and 370 cliton. the electoral college gave a more accurate result of who sould of win the election.

That's why I think that the electoral college is better it gives certainty of outcome, balances out the big states, and avoids run-off elections. While popular vote does give us the same certainty.
