With the information that has been found there's no prove that the Face has been structured by aliens. Scientist have stated that the Face was form by natural causes, others say that they may have found more information about the Face but than what they are saying. The Face was made by natural landform not created by aliens.

The face wasn't stuctured by aliens so therefore was made by natural landform. NASA has plenty of evidence that the Face was form naturally, for example that it hasn't really been discovered that aliens actually exsist. Throught the years of 1976 and 2001 there were pictures of the face not yet comepletely form so therefore scientist think it took 25 years to form comepletely. Others may say that NASA has more information than what they are telling us. For instants in the article "Unmasking the Face on Mars," in paragraph 5 it states that "evidence that NASA would rather hide." I argue that the Face wasn't created by aliens but from natural landforms.

Natural landforms, created by aliens no one will actually really know what they think. I think it was naturally formed not created by aliens there really is no real evidence about it created by aliens. There could be thousand possibilites that it was form naturally or created by aliens. There are plenty reasons to believe that it was natural causes but not as much as it being created by aliens, after all who doesn't love a good mystery.
