Student should designed the summer project because it gives them more freedom, more experience and it is life-changing.

However, not everyone would agree with this position. Some people may argue that teacher should designed the summer project. For example it challengingÂ and you will learn more. Nevertheless, there are other viewpoint to consider.

To begin with, it gives you more freedom. For example, in India there was a kid named Generic_Name, sometime when the teacher was not in the class room. He always help his class mates, one day his teacher give them a project and he decide to do a toy little rocket, also he decide to test the rocket and it worked. And now he win the grand winner award by the President of India.

In addition, it gives you more experience. For example, in schools teacher are the one who do all the work, and if a student did not do his work, it will be a waste of time for the student and the teacher. If we allow student to make their own work they will know how hard is also they gain experience by doing the project by them self.

Finally, it is life-changing. For example, in Generic_City schools they have to take every class every year and some extra load on the top. But expert for one thing it was summer school project, because they want their student to relay on their self not on the others. Sometime when you do the work on your own, you known how hard is the work and you will more learn by the work you did in the end.

If we allow the student to do their work on their self. They will know how hard is it and they will force their self to the limit to do better at ever thing they do, also it gain more experience to do it right and freedom to think of an idea they have and life-changing is the one put it to together in the end to make it better.
