The electoral college been around for a long time. Some of the states don't like it, because most states doesn't even see the campaign. Sometimes people don't really know who there voting for. when the candidate promiss may be the compleate oppsite once there president.

More of the smaller states aren't to happy with the electorial college, Because of it the canidates dont want to go to the smaller states. They would go to the bigger states so they would have a bigger number of votes then with a smaller number. Thats why the smaller states are up set with the electoral college. One thing people dont like about voting is once you have a president they don't follow what they promiss.

When the canidates become president after getting all the big states. They dont do what they promiss. What people thought who they picked was all for change, and just makes their own rules that not helping,but hurting everyone is why the smaller states are up set about it.

The electoral college needs to change, because their not being fair to the other states that only have a few people living in them. They could of make a difference in what the out come is. The electoral college been aroud for a very long time. They need to come up with a new way to find our president.
