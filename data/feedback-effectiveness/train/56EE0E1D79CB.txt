I think handling elections by popular votes is a much more resonable way of dealing with election. When you send your electors to vote for your state its really them selecting the president that they choose, which could either be the one you wanted or not. The other thing about the electorial vote is that who are the electors? who picks them? Popular vote does not only allow the people to have the president they want but does not cause more viloence and disruption.

The electorial vote is not always going to be the vote you want, like any normal human being if you dont like something you are not going to agree to it. So you really cant trust if you are going to end up with the right president. Who is picking the electors anyway? Random people are going to vote for our president. Why should we trust them?

Sticking with popular vote is going to be much easier on law enforcment and people we need to protect our citizens and states. When the poeple dont get what they want they tend to get angry and then it breaks out into vandalisim and a huge hassel. Such as when intergation was allowed, the citizens that were still racists towards the blacks and didnt like the changing of the law they had mobs of people roaming the streets causing disruption and destroying the additude towards the celebration of equality.

The whole system of electoral college is messed up because just the the election back in 2012 "Obama's electorial vote was 61.7 and then the popular vote concluded with a 51.3, that doesnt seem fair no does it?

So the only realalistic way of the new voting system is by popular vote because its fair, there is less harm, and because we know who's voting for our president. Like i previously stated "Popular vote does not only allow the people to have the president they want but does not cause more viloence and disruption."
