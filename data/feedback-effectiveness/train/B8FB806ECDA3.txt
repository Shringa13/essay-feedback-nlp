Dear Principle,

A lot of students are separated on the opinion of doing community service. I think you should let the students decide whether we should be required or not be required to do community service. I seen classmates who like to do community service. They do more hours of service than what is actually required! I've also seen students who strongly dislike community service. They would lie about what they did for community service. Most people would like it for extra credit for certain classes. Other people want it for 100% of their final grade in all of their classes. The students are very split in their opinions. I am the few students who are in the middle. People in the student council and I, believe that is your decision to make.

I am showing you the opinions of all the students in middle school. I hope you will make the right decision.

From,
