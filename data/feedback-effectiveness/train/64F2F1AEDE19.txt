Luke had no idea that his life would change so soon after his high school graduation. He was working two part-time jobs in agrocey store and a bank when his friend Don invited him to go to Europe on a cattle boat. Luke couldn't say no.

In 1945, World War 2 was over in Europe,and manu countries were left ruins. To help these countries recover their food and supplies,animals, and more, 44 nations joined together to help the nation they are called the Seagoing Cowboys to take care of the horses, young cows, and mules that were shiped overseas.

By the time he was discharged in 1947,Luke had made nine trips-the most of any Seagoing Cowboy. I had the side benifit of seeing Europe and China. But seeing the Acroplis in Greece was special,he says. So taking a gondola ride in Venice,Italy,a city with streets of water. A cargo of 335 horses plus enough hay and oats to feed them.

It took two weeks to cross the Atlantic Ocean from the eatern coast of the United States and a month to get to china. Caring for animals during the crossings kept Luke busy. They fed the animals three times a day water,bales of hay,and bags of oats. Stalls had to be cleaned.

Being a Seagoing cow was much more than an adventure for Luke. It opened up the world to him. "Im grateful for the opportunity,"he says. It made him more aware of people of other countries and their needs.

In conclusion Luke had the best time of his life being a Seagoing Cowboy he didn't no his life would change so soon after his high school graduation. In 1945 world war 2 made places get ruined so he decied to go to Seagoing Cowboys. He help animals like horses,young cows,and mules too. He had so much to do but he did it and yes it was hard but he did what he was suppossed to do. A Seagoing Cow boy was more than an adventure for Luke. It opened the world up to him. He is gratefull of the opportunity.
