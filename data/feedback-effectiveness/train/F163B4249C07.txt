I think that we should be aloud to have phones at school because what if there is somebody that died or is in the hospital now . The school never answerer the phone so they can talk to parents. That is why we should be aloud to have phone in this hell hole. The teachers would not like that but they could get over it and like it. I don't no why they think we don't take are phone to class because we do. The teachers have there's and they ant aloud to have them. There phone go off and they don't get in trouble like we do. I think that is wrong but you no how they pay each other so they wont right each other up. They don't have the right to play on the phone.

The teacher think they should be aloud to have there phone but we ant. I think teachers should not be aloud to have phone if cant. If they pass the law then it wont be as bad.

I think it is wrong for the teachers to take your phone away.

If teachers have there phone we should be aloud to take them away and take them to the principal. If we did that then the teacher would have a problem on picking on us.
