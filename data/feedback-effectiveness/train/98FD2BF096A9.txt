Intro

Do you want a messed up system to control who is voted for president, or would you want to vote for who becomes president? In my favor, I would choose the most popular vote for president. In my defense people should vote for president and not have higher ranked people vote for president. To be clear with you,

The Electoral College should not be used.

Would you want to vote for who becomes president?

I would love to vote for who would become president. Why would you let people that do not live the life you live vote for you, you need to vote for who you think will be a great president for you.

For EX.

I'm living in a retirement home and I cant pay for my dentures I would need to vote for a president that allows charity for retirement homes. different people need different presidents we all can't have a different president so we all need one that we all agree on. people living in the white house do not know what we want so why would you want them to vote.

Would you use

The Electoral College
