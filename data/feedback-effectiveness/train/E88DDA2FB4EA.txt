The author supports the idea of exploring venus, because Venus is simple to see from the distant but safe vantage point of earth. However, it has proved a very challenging place to examine more closely. Often referred to as Earth's "twin," Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size.

A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus. Even more challengin are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venu's atmosphere. On the planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet. These conditions are far more extreme than anything humans encounter on Earth; such a enviroment would crush even a submarine accustomed to diving to the deepest parts of our oceans and would liquefy many metals.

Striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value, not only because off the insight to eb gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors. Our travels on earth and beyond should not be limited by danger and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation.
