Should summer projects be teacher-designed or student-designed?

I think it should be student designed, because some students take the summer to travel to family members houses and stuff like that. So i think if the mom thinks the student needs to go to summer school that's her decion, students stay in school for 9 months a year so that's plenty of time to get everything they need done by summer. that can cause alot of disagreements with the family. Let's say the mom wants you to go to summer school but the dad thinks otherwise because yall already have plans to do somthing different, summer school can cause an arguement.

I think if it was a teacher-designed, some teachers would only pick certian kids that they didn't like or somthing maybe and that wouldn't be far, also the teachers wouldn't know if they already have plans for somthing different or not. It should be the parents decions why or why not. But if it was a teacher-designed more students would come and catch up on more work or somthing like that so it could also be good at the same point, for instence let's say your behide on a sol and have to gradute in the summer if you would of just went to summer school in ur highschool days maybe you wouldn't have to gradute in the summer. So it could go both ways i think but if your a student then you should know if you need to go to summer school or not because it won't be fair for your parents to know everything, you got a part in it to.

therefor, i think it should be students-designed because they might have plans for the summer or might not need summer school. But if they need it and don't go then it's there fault not the teachers because atleast they provide summer school to students that need it.
