Dear,Florida I think that we should keep the Electoral College becuase it keeps the number of votes and it produces a clear winner. The Electoral College restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states (by population) lose by virtue of the senate decreed in the constitution. The Electoral College is a process that consists of 538 electors. Each state equals the number of members in the house of representives. The Electoral also select what their responsibilities are. The Electoral college is widely regarded as an anachronism a non-democratic method. The Electoral College is also a mordern sense. Also no region (south,northeast,etc.) has enough electoral votes to elect a president. Residents also feel that their votes dont get counted that the new president will have no regard for thier interest, that he really isnt their president.

Electoral College alson avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of the vote cast.
