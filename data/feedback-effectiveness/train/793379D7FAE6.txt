Dear Principle,

Hello, my name is STUDENT_NAME and I would like to discuss a policy about cell phones that I heard you were considering.

I personally think that policy 1, the one when kids are allowed to bring cell phones to school and use them during lunch and free periods but must be turned off during class, is the right one.

One reason why I think that this policy is the right one is because kids should have cell phones.

It's a great way to communicate with your friends and family.

But if you are going to install this rule, there must be some limits. Kids should turn their cell phones off during class because it could distract the teacher, the class, and the person him/herself. If a teacher sees a kid playing with a cell phone or if it goes off in class, the teacher should take it away. But another good reason to have cell phones is if the school has a fire or another emergency.

Kids could easily get in touch with their parents to let the know that they are all right. Also, another thing not a lot of people think about that could be good or bad is homework.

Kids could text each other to find out what the homework is if they don't have it, but they could also send texts or pictures of the answers.

A reason that I would question about: what about teachers?

Would teachers be allowed to have their phones out whenever they wanted?

Or can they only have them out if they have some free time?

This is all something that could impact the education of the kids, but I'll let you decide that one.

One more reason kids would love to have their cell phones in school is that they can take pictures of their friends in school if there was an unforgettable moment or something like a cool memory to capture.

There are numerous reasons good or bad to install the rule about cell phones, but I hope that you will consider this letter in your deciding.
