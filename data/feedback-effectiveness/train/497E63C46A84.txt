I believe that this computer would work wonders in a classroom. It could allow teachers to know which of the children in the classroom are having problems understanding the lesson, allowing the teacher to help them more. This could also help other studys of the human anatomy, as it shows how facial expressions are done and also what they mean. In the famous, "Mona Lisa" painting, many people observe her smile and think that she is being forced to smile, and that she is actually scared, frighted, or just angry. Using this computer means that we could debunk/prove this theory. This could also solve crimes, some that have not been solved to this day!

This computer could also help with crimes as it could show that if a suspect is making a certain facial expression, they are lying or telling the truth. This could help police catch people who are breaking the law, but not put others in prison for nothing. This computer could help with these problems that occur in the real world, and it would save lives in the process. This would be very helpful in peoples daily lives, and it could help people who have problem such as mental health. If a child is slower than other children, this test could help decide whether or whether not these children need the extra help. If they do need help, this machine could even put them in the correct classes!
