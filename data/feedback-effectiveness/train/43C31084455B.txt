Phones & Driving

I am going to show my opinion about Texting or being on the phone while driving and, I show some you'll what could happened when you decide to be on the phone while driving. An I hope when you are reading this, I hope you chance your mind about texting while driving and I should thank all my reader for taking the time up to reading this essay.

When you are driving a car you hear a text pop up on your phone and you want to get it so bad and you do but, when you do you stop paying attention to the road for just a minute then a car behind you hunks because you aren't driving right and that make you jump so you start driving right. The driver was just lucky that he just got hunk at or it could've binned much worst like a car accident, and someone could have got hurt. In my opinion people shouldn't not be texting while driving because it only takes a simple mistake, and someone could get hurt. I think that it was a good idea that modern cars develop cars that you can call people and talk to people on the phone while driving plus they have their full attention. When you are texting while driving you looking up and down while driving and I would suggest people should put that do not disturb on your phone or you can put it in the glove department, so you won't be interrupted while driving.

My conclusion to all this is drive safe because I don't want to look on the news and see anybody getting hurt because of you are on your phone. If you don't care do it to save the other people from driving and I see why they are pushing this to be outlaws so there could be less accident on the road. I hope and thank you for reading my essays.
