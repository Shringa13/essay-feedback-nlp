The author supports his ideas in this passage good because he lists all the good details when he's going to support something. When the author talks about the Venus he has explantation showing how to explain that. In the passage it says " Venus is the second planet from our sun". It's also in our solar system, Venus is sometimes called '"Evening Star",is one of the brighest points in the sky. The author has different details and has found them.

The author talks about different stuff how our sister plant is so inhospitable". Scientists also see and search what's going on in the world and in the planets. I think it's good that we know some of these stuff so we know in the future that can happen. If you don't know none of these details you can search stuff online.

It's also good knowing these stuff because it's better to know them. Scientists do a lot of researching that's going around the world and earth. Also Venus is worthy to know what dangercan happen. It can get to 170 degrees Fahrenheit the air will be close to the area.

The solar power would be plentiful, and radiation would not exceed earth levels. Also says in paragraph 5 that's not easy conditions, but survivable for humans. Venus from a ship orbiting or havering safely far above. There is different facts about everything.

For the last paragraph it should be about how the world is working now. In paragraph 8 striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus. There should be limits by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination. Imagine exposing the cellphone and all that.
