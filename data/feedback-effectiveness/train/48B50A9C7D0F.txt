Dear Principal,

I as a student here at your school do not think students should be forced to do community service. There is a multitude of reasons why this is not a good idea. We do not have enough time, some of us are not capable, and I believe this would put to much power in the hands of the school.

Most every student has a sport that they are playing and have many tests a weak. If community service was required we would not be able to pursue these to the best of our abilities. When practice starts we would have to be doing service and coaches would become very angry as well as the students because of missed practices. If we have test the next day at school and we have to do well on it to pass the class we might not be able to because we were being forced to do service.

Just because of you we would fail our classes and our sports.

Some students in our grade are physically not able to do service. The have broken arm or ankle and can't really do anything. Also some are not all there mentally and would probably hurt more than they helped. So then instead of trying to help our town you hurt it because you force unfit students to do service.

Lastly, this would put way to much power in the hands of the school. Our schedules are all ready revolve around school and this would make it way to difficult for us. We have the right do what we want under restraints of the law according to the law. The school does not have the right to force us to do community service.

Thank you for taking this into consideration and taking the time to read this. It is greatly appreciated. I hope you will be swayed in favor my proposal after you see it is the only logical option. Thanks again.

Sincerely,
