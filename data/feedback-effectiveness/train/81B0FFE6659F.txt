The future is near and the talk about driverless cars is upon us. Driverless cars give us the oppertunity to save thousands of dollars in buying cars and paying for repairs. This also would be a lot more flexable than a bus because, the driverless cars could take us to our exact destination. Plus the driverless car idea would use half of the amount of fuel we use today.

The struggle we face on saving up to buy a car would not be a problem to us anymore. Multiple teens who already stress because of school have to also handle a job on top of that just to buy a car. Some even have to give up activities they love because of their jobs. Adults spend thousands of dollars just to buy cars and then have the risk of having to spend even more money when they break down to repair them. Cars are expensive items and the money we spend on them could go to other things like vacations, bills, and food.

Buses today have a certain route they follow on a daily basis. They are only capable of taking you to the closest bus stop to your desired location, this could still be a mile walk away from your destination. With driverless cars it would serve to you more as a taxi that takes you where you want to go. This saves us a lot of time because if you are late for the bus and have to wait on the next one or you still have a long walk even after you are dropped off.

The polution fuel causes would decrease by 50%. The driverless cars are projected to use only half the amount of fuel cars and buses are usuing today. This makes earth a lot healthier and safer to live on for you and your family.

Driverless cars are a great change for the would. Makes your life a lot cheaper, safer, and saves you a lot of time. The talk of the future is here and the driverless cars are near.
