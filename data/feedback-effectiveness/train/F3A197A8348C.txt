Dear Principal,

In my perspective as a student I honestly like policy one better because I use my phone a lot out of school.

I believe that it would be a good policy if students followed this policy, though most student don't follow most of the rules in school anyways.

I support policy one because I would like to be able to use my phone during lunch and text others who are on the other side of the room, instead of walking over there.

This is also another good policy because sometimes the duty aids will make us go back to our seat even if we just wanted to ask a quick question.

As I said earlier, as a student I like policy one better, but I believe the staff of our school would personally like policy two better.

I believe they would like policy two better, because how I also said earlier, some of the students don't even follow most of rules at school, especially the current cell phone policy.

I think the staff would probably end up taking more cell phones if they established policy one because students wouldn't turn their cell phones off because they were just currently using and they didn't have enough time before class to turn it off, or they forgot.

Once I rethink the cell phone policy, I believe it would be better if they kept the original cell phone policy that it has to stay in your locker.
