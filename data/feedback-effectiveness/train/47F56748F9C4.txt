Dear Senator,

I text you because I want changement for now I don't want to keep the Electoral College I want to have Election by popular vote for the next president.

Because if you have a vote who comptabled to more vote than another vote of citizens it's not fair...

If you give one vote for one citizens and one vote for all people who leave in United States that's more fairy for the candidat for the Presidential Electoral and for the citizens,

I think it's as better idea because the election are more fairy and the president can look how many people vote for him after, why a citizens cannot have plus votes than a Electoral College why?

If you give more votes to a citizenÂ  I think you can have a problem because if one citizen have three or four votes there are so much votes and if all the Electoral College votes for the same candidat. He has got more chances be elected maybe.

It's my personal oppinion because I really want to help my country because of him I tell you now he's gave me a work, my family all my life if the United States are never here I'm not here to because It's my land...

If you can do something to changesd this or do a representatif election to vote this that's will very nice for the citizens and the United States.

Thank you so much for all you did a good job.
