Voting for whos the next president can be hard. Theres so many things to consider, like who will support you the best and make the right desition. The government has made two types of ways to vote, Electoral College and popular vote. I believe that we should go with the popular vote method. When voting like this its not a confusing, Theres no missing ad campaigns, and in the winner take all you dont rule out another persons elector for his chose.

Using popular vote for electing our president is better then Electoral College i believe because its not that confusing. In Electoral College you vote for a wet number of electors and they give their own vote on their behalf. Now with popular vote say one state votes for president b rather then president a then the state votes for president b.

In ppular vote both presidents are trying to win you over so they will make a campaign. what if you never see the campaign? This is what can happen in the Electoral College method. If a president knows that a certain state will not vote for them then the president wont perade around there. Therefore the state cant make a correct decision.

The popular vote method is very diffrent as you have seen in the paragraphs above. One reason I prefer the popular vote method over the Electoral College is do to the winner take all in ruling out the electors that didnt vote for the president. So if theopposing pesident winns the election then he can single you out for note voting for him and i dont believe thats fair.

So when it comes to election day which method will you chose? Electoral College or popular vote you know that im going to stick with popular vote because Electoral College can be confusing, the ad campaignsÂ  cna be unfair and ruling out the opposing electors.
