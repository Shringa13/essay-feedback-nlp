In this story the author is talking about how humas have not made it on the planet of Venis. At least that we know about. The article said that scientits think there may be life or have been life on the planet.

With scientists thinking if there is something up there on the planet there is a good chance that they will be able to find out soon with all the technology we have today.

With all the things we have today I think we will find something on venus. If we do then there is a fact that there is aliens that are alive, unless they are just like us but from another planet. And that planet is closer to the sun than earth.

I think with all the things in the article we will find somthing or that there was something there on venus at some point. It could of been a trillion years ago or there is still life on it today we will just have to find out. Time is the only thing that we have on are side.
