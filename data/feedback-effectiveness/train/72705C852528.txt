I think that the Face is just a oddly shaped rock, it probably just got there from sandy winds and erotion taking place on a mesa and that is what made it to be like that from, from my experience with the Bible it says there is nothing else in the universe to do harm to the earth, except for sin and satin. The Lord thy God will never but something like that in the universe to do us harm.

From th excerpt it says that at that time it was a windy mounth on Mars and from that I think that it got there from erosion, for atleast a couple hundred years it would had to be wearing away, because that huge of a rock can not possibly get worn away that fast but i guess since we found it like this a rock on Mars in the Crydonia and some how it lookes like a face, and over to the next century it would probably change and look like somthing else a new shape it would not stay like that for long. But it would be a cool conspicury to think that aliens make a cool looking rock formation of a Egyphian Pharoah known as the Face.

Also from the excerpt says that it a a butte or a mesa that got eroded away over time, and also if there was a alien life form on Mars we could see it because we have this high packed pixle camera that can take a photo of Mars and we can see them and there homes on our monitors the camera is called the Mars Global Suveryor an dby the intension of that shuddle we can see all things big or small.
