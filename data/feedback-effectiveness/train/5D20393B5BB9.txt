Dear principal,

I have recently heard that you are reconsidering the schools cell phone policy. While I do respect whatever choice you make in the end, I'd hope that you would consider my thoughts on the issue.

I believe that children should be allowed to bring their phones to school, therefore I support policy one.

First of all, many kids our age make decisions during the school day of what they would like to do after school.

Wither it be going to a friend's house of staying after for extra help.

Kids need these phones to communicate with their parents while still on school grounds so they don't miss the bus or can't get home.

Also, if children have free time it should be their choice what they do with it.

During free block phones should be allowed because kids might not have any work to do, answer should be able to choose what they do during their "free" time. Projects that are done as a group would be easier to complete if cell phone use is permitted. If the kid wants to use their phone to communicate with a person in a different classroom they should be allowed to as long as it is not disruptive to other students.

One way to avoid this is to require all phones to be set on vibrate so that the rings are not disruptive.

Thank you for your consideration,
