Dear Principal,

I strongly believe that community service is something good, and that all the students should be willing to perform community service in some way. Community service teaches us many valuable things.

And it also gives us the opportunity to aid others that need it.

Community service is very important in many ways. First, is a way of helping, and growing together as a community.

Also, we shouldn't expect someone else to do our job. We are the future of our community/country; and if we are growing up expecting we don't have to do anything, we will have very few chances of being successful.

It is definitely not a waste of time.

We can do many things we like for community service.

Like if we like math, or are good at it, we could tutor those who need more help. Or if we are interested in justice, or working for peace, we could volunteer at places that do that kind of work.

Furthermore, community service doesn't have to be boring, we could take our friends, or siblings. Then they will learn from our example, we will have company, and our virtues will spread throughout our community.

Finding ways to perform community service is very easy; just talk to your parents, neighbors, classmates, etc. Something else is that it doesn't have to be the biggest thing ever. Small actions will lead to great achievements.

Doing small actions every day, sometimes without even planning, will help our community grow in many ways.

We will also benefit from these actions. When we need help we will know that our neighbor or classmate will be there to help us and will take care of us. When we are older, the younger kids we showed all those virtues, will keep passing them to their family, friends. Soon we will see all the great things we achieved.

Please help us develop a great community, learn great things, and give us different
