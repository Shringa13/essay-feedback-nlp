When you think of "driverless cars" it sounds impossible, right? Well google is actually thinking of ways to make it happen. There are a lot of people who say yes to it, but also a lot of people who are very opposed to it. But me personally, I think it wold be a very useful and helpful thing. It would help transport faster and you'd be able to travel for a long time.

There are smart cars in the world. There have always been smart cars. But, why can't we take it to the next level of not even having to drive anymore? With driverless cars, you can get to places if you're in a hurry, and not even be late. Think of rushing out the door to catch a cab, jumping into the car without even having to stear or anything? It would help a lot of peoples lives especially with time.
