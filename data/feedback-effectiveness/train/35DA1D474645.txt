Venus is sometimes called the " Evening Star". It is one of the bright points of light in the night sky. Venus is also more closely to earth then any other planet. Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers because is our planetary neightbor. Venus is a Earth's twin.

Humans have sent numerous of spacecrafts to venus but for inly a couple of hours. Which actually is a good idea because not one single spaceship was able to go back to Venus more then three decades ago. Venus is almost 97 percent carbon dioxide. Venus planet surface is almost 800 degrees

Farenheit.

The conditions are far more extreme then anything humas encounter on Earth.

Venus could have probably be covered in large amounts of oceans and could have been supported by humans. It could be hard ot go back to Venus becuase of the pressure that spaceship could get. In order to go back, they have to try and make the mission both safe and scientifically productive. But it could not be productive if the solar power is plentiful and the radiation would not exceed Earths levels. It could be easy conditions to some humnas, but not all.

However, NASA is working on some approches to get to Venus. Some simplified electronics made of silicone carbide, have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus's surface. Modern computers are enormously powerful, flexible, and quick. but it can be extremly delicate when it comes to physical conditions. The traveling on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edged of imagination and innovation.
