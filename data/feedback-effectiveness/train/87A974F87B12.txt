To the principal of SCHOOL_NAME;

Of the new policy of cell phone, students should be allowed to bring cell phones to school, and to be also used only on free time periods like lunch.

The reason why students should bring their cell phones is because students can use them for emergencies and other uses like calling their parents to pick them up after school. If phones are used in class, they may get a warning or be taken away by the teacher. When taken by the teacher, they may receive their phone after the class period.

When an emergency happens, Students can call their parents or call for help when they are instructed to do so.

Calling their parents can let them know that they are all safe from a natural disaster. Either it is a flood, earthquake, tornado, etc. Students letting their parents know that they are fine shows the responsibility they carry.

Calling parents after school can let them know what time their child gets out of school. When not having a cell phone, certain students have to use the phones in class and/or the ones in the office. If so, they may or may not be able to get out of school on time. Parents always have to make sure they leave on time to know what happens at school and after school.

Having parents to know that their child is doing good in school means that their parents are happy that their child had a grea

The last reason why phones should be brought to school is because that students should enjoy a nice school year. Having a great school year for students means that they can memorize all the times they had for the year. Letting them know they had fun is that it leaves them with a happy day. It can make kids happy for themselves and the people around them. Also it makes friends closer with one another when they talk about their day.

This is why the policy of having phones ay school for emergencies, parent pick-ups, and the excitement for students.
