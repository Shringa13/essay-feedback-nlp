Scientist Rafael, There's no way it was created by aliens, I think it was just a natural landform because on April 5, 1998, when Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time, Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos, Anyway thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all, So Scientist Rafael that's proof, that it can't be created by aliens and it's a natural landform, well that's one of the evidence.

Also, in Nevertheless, on April 8, 2001 a cloudless summer day in Cydonia Mars Global Surveyor drew close enough for a second look. "We had to roll the spacecraft 25 degrees to center the Face in the field of view," said Garvin. "Malin's team captured an extraordinary photo using the camera's absolute maximum resolution." Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo, So I think it'similar, the picture actually shows the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa landforms common around the American West. "That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars."

From 1976 to 2001, the images changed into a human face formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth." That doesn't mean it was created by aliens and besides, we didn't find no ancient civilization on Mars. I think it was a natural landform and that's all the evidence that i have for you, "Scientist Rafael."
