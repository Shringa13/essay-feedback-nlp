To keep or not to keep the electoral college , that is the question . Everbodys ansewer is different but my ansewer is to abolish it . This system did work in the 17th to about the late 19th centrrey but now now in this day and age the old system is like the gamecube , it had a good run and serived it's purpose but now its time to move on to better and more up to date system . Now thats out of the way lets see what should the new system could possably be .

First up , by the people of the U.S.A. . What I mean by that is the poplare vote . With this system everyone's vote matter . Lets say that to win the vote you have to have ten thusand ore votes than your oppint or something like that . I really don't know the best way to do the voting system but this could should be solved by the gonverment and not the high school student that is writing this . Other than that lets move on .

Next one up , Repesitives . I know there is something like this but do this base on population . Like for every 10,000 there is one repesitive or something like that . This could be a cleaner and faster system than the one in the first paragraph . Both of the system mainly focus on the people so you can't do wrong with ether of this systems . Thatsall I have to say about this system .

Now the moment you been waiting for , update the old system . Sometimes all you have to do is update the old system . The system is out datted but if you update it you could make it better . It may or may not work work but you do this right this system could last the U.S.A. a nother 300 years .

In conclusion , this is what you could do to replace the system . There are many more but to me this are the three best systems I can think of so I hope you agree with me . Other than that I wish you farlwell .
