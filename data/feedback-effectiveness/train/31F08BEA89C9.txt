I think the rock that landed in mars was meybe because it had came from a diffrent place or maybe because the rock was to old or to heavy. The rock may have move to Mars or landed in Mars maybe because something hit it and it just went to a diffrent place and it landed in Mars.

The rock maybe have laded and make or had a face shape from the way it landed. Im not so sure if it had landed like that to make a face shape. That's what I am thinking, is that it was like that from the way it had moved or it had changed. Some pople are surprised that they haved found a human face in the or in a planet. I know its kinda wierd but u never know what could happen.

They say it had a human face. They say it had eyes and it had a nose and it had a mouth in the face. They should be scared because what if it was aliens that did that and that made the face. I would be scared but maybe it wasent the aliens maybe it was just regular. It just could've been Something regular or sothing natural that just happen.
