Dear Principle i have herd that you are deciding whether all students should perform in the community service. I think it will be a great idea for our school and for our community. This will be able to help people know that if we do are work together as a group we will accomplish more work and that not just one man can do everything but if we are united we will succeeds. By doing all of this it will be able to make are town cleaner and let people know that we care about this town. By the way this will be a great opportunity for our community to be clean so if different people who comes from different places will make good judgement about are community and maybe they might tell their friends how they think about it. I hope you make your mind to say yes but whatever you choose I will still be happy with it.

Sincerely STUDENT_NAME
