The author suggest that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit because it is often referred to as Earth's twin. It is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size. A difference would be a thick atmosphere. NASA's solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray. Humans are curious of what Venus is like.

In paragraph 4, Venus could have once had oceans. It could have supported various forms of life just like Earth. Venus today still has some features that are analogous to those on Earth. It has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters. If scientists were able to study Venus, it would help us undertsnad the planet more.

It is hard to study Venus because the atmosphere is almost 97 percent carbon dioxide. Also even more challenging are the clouds. They consist of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in the atmosphere. On Venus's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit. Venus's atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet.

In paragraph 5, it states that NASA has one particulary compelling idea for sending humans to study Venus. They want scientists to be able to float above the fray. It says that solar power would be plentiful, and radiation would not exceed Earth levels. These are not easy conditions, but are survivable for humans. It is important for them to get up close and personal despite the risks. There are many researchers that are working on innovations that would allow our machines to last long enough to study Venus.

The author supports the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit because it is important. Venus is like Earth's twin. It is possible to humans to study this planet. NASA has ideas that will help find ways to study Venus. Technology can also help us in these experiments. In conclusion, Venus would be just another planet like Earth.
