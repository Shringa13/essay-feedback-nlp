You should go with policy number one because students should have time to use their cell phones during school but not during class time. The reason why not during class time is because no one will pay attention to you when you are teaching because they will be texting. They should use it during their free time because what is the use having a cell phone if you can't use it during school. I don't have a cell phone because there is no room on the plan for me right now because I have five sisters and four brothers. In my school you are aloud to bring your cell phones but you can't use it at all in school. People should be able to bring and use their cell phones in their spare time. People who has a cell phone shouldn't use it when they have to study because that is just waste of time and you will get bad grades.
