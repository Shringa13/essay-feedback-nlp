Studing Venus is a good idea because they is so much people have to learn about it and peope dont. You could learn and knoe so much about Venus. Its a good idea he has so much on it and it good be good stuff that no one knows about. Its is known as earths twin. They have sent many space craft all of them have only lasted a hour or so. Thats why they havent send a lot of people up there to stay. It has the hotest tempeter of any planet. They have talked about more visites to Venus. It formiler futers as earth. They want to send people to Venus to study it. THey want to have a car that well be able to just say off the ground so they can go there. They cant take samples or rock or gas that far away from it they wouyld have to be up close. They are working on other wys to be able to go up there and learn more about it. It has went up on how many people want to go up there and explore. I think the arthor suported the idea well. I think that in the next cople of years people well be able to go there an resurch and get the stuff they want from there. Like studing the rock and whatever ese they have up there. He made a lot of good statments about how we wouldnt be able to get thst close because the remputer is so hot. Even if you whernt thst close it would still be 170 degrees and that is still really hpot and can hurt someone. they would have to figure out a outfit or suit that can make it do its not so hot so they can go up there and resurch. They would have to make a rocket that could float because it the rocket touched Venus it would melt and they would die up there. But over all i think the aother made good statments about it and what would have to hapen to go up there.
