Do you think it is important to seek out advice from more than one person?

When found in a situation, many people ask others for their advice during the situation to very the outcome. If you ask more than one person for their advise or opinion on how to handle something, you will get multiple different answers. That should make the situation easier to handle, because you can see how it might end if you choose a certain way to deal with it. Someone you ask for advice from might have been in the same situation you are in, and can help you handle it. But you won't know if they have been in the same situation if you don't ask multiple people.

Asking multiple people for advice can, help you with a delimia, get you different opinions from different standpoints on a situation, and can make sure you are making a wise decision instead of an impulsive one.

You have a job at a retail marketing company as the social media manager, making 13 dollars and hour, have only been working for them for 4 months, and is only a 15 minute drive from your house. But there is another job offer, it is also a retail market company, but you would handle finances, and get paid 22 dollars an hour, and it is the next state over and is a 3 hour drive, you have all of your family here and just bought a house, your degree is in consumer finances. What do you do? You seek advice from a lot of people, get their opinions, see which one is better for you future, and make a decision off of the advice given to you. Remember, get multiple peoples' advice and opinions to make a wise decision instead of an impulsive one.
