How can a facial action coding system can identify a persons initial facial exspretion? Well what it does and how it can be helpful, useful and then it can solv a lot of mystreys in some cases. If somebody can tell what feelings there exspressing can be helpful in a way by telling somebody like a doctors that studys people when there just angry, sad or happy. And that tecnology can help when others are in a certain state of depresion and that certain somebody doesent want to be noticed that machine can help with a person they may commit suicide. When no one knows it but the machiene can tell if there just trying to put on a good face over a really bad time. So then how can it be useful it will also sovle some unusal cases like some artisis make and no one will ever understand what they were trying to go for inside the person. Like the Mona Lisa some people will probably never understand what if just is smiling or grining for the picture. If this invention coms out permanatly that it can show a poll of how kids view homework and then show how some people view work places. If they are dicustuing or just p a place you dont want to goto. Then it also solves the basic stuff like make face detecting how people fell about some presidents andit can solve cases if a person was happy or he was mad to tell if a person was a killer or not. So in conclusion I think it is very useful in my opinon and I hope they make more of these inventions
