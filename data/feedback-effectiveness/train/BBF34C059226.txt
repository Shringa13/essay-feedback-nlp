The author in the story suggests of the idea of going to venus and studying as

''earth's twin''. That with the author's idea of pursuiting to Venus. Even through with the dangers of it by studying to go there does'nt sound too bad to think of. Venus is the closed planet to earth. That people are looking to traval to Mars well Earth,Venus and Mars are neighbor's there is a diffrentce Mars is not as hot as Venus, is closer to the sun.

Venus is some times closer to Earth the Mars is humans have send spacecafts to land on Venus but one thing about the dangers no human shoukd go it would be something to look in too. Going to Venus would be hard knoing that no spacecarfts surviced the landing for more than a few hours. Venus is something that is not a good idea knowing that the average is over 800 degrees is nothing to play with just to go to Venus.
