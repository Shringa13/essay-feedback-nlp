The face on Mars is just a natural landform. I think this because the face reminds someone of middle butte in the snake river plain of Idaho.

Just becuase the face is in movies and magazines do not make it true their is lots of story in magzines that is not true.

If this was a face,The face would have been gone after 25 years later. The picture may look like a face but its just a landform.

I think the face is just a landform bacause the picture is actually showing is a mesa lanform that can be mistaken by a face.

The face on mars can be related to some things on earth like the middle of the butte in the snake river plain of Idaho.

When someone had made the picture larger the face just looked more and more like a mesa or a butte landform. Micheal malin went to take more pictures which was more clear and he found out that it is just a natural landorm.

I'm not the only one who believes that the face on mars is just a lanform. a scientist want more proof of this so went to take more pictures and he found out the true about this face. For the people who believes the face is real just go to JPL web site, you can find better picture of it and you will see what I'm see. Which is just a landform mistaken for an alien face.

These are some reason why you should believe me when i said the face is just a landform nothing else not and alien face or an human face. I understand why someone would think this is a alien face because the first picture was not so clear and it did look like a face.

But now there is a better picture on this web site thats show nothing but a landform.
