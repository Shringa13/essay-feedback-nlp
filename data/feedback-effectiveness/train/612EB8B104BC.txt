Transportation or cars will always have an huge impact on the economy. Think about how many people use cars today. Driverless cars has many positive aspects, but lets focus on the negative outcomes. Driverless cars would change the entire world!

Look at the companies making computer-driven cars compared to the cars that need humans. There are hundreds of places manufacturing cars that considerably need humans. If computer-driven cars take over sommany people woukd lose out on jobs that they have. If people lose their jobs most would not be able to afford driverless cars.

If the technology of the car was to fail and there is an accident there is question about who should take the blame. Safety is one of the major concerns. The manufacturer or the driver? This issue alone can cause conflict. If certain laws change the entire technology of thounsands of driverless cars must be updated,right? With so much debt at our hands I do not believe that driverless cars should be anywhere close to growing closer to the people by 2020.
