I agree that students should have an extracurricular activity. It can help them stay active, and also help the school out a lot. Having an extracurricular activity means having a extra thing to do in school that you like that will provide for the school; like for an example: being the school announcer in the morning it's something that you like that will provide for the school and it is why students should have an extracurricular activity.

The extracurricular activity is effective to students and it will help them pursue in the future. Example: say if Generic_Name was very shy to talk in front of a class, but he really want to become a business man and it requires talking in front of is business partners about business, but he still to shy to talk; so he does a extracurricular activity about debating and he found confidence in his self, and now he can talk in front of class presentations and it will help him to become a better business man. that's an example of the effects that it do to a student's character.

Extracurricular activity's can also give some relive to the principal's, if the students help out the principal than the the principal won't have too much too do on that day like for dances, pep rallies, and meetings and thats why students should have an extracurricular activies.
