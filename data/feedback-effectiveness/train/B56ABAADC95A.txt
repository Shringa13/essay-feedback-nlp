Process or Place? This is a question you need to ask yourself. Yes, in my opinion, Electoral College is a good idea.

In the cases of having an Electoral College there are some up sides of this and some down sides. In an Electoral College it restores some of the weight in political balance. It also required a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal.

When an Electoral College restores th balance in some large states its a good thing. It states in this article that, " The popular vote was very close in Flordia, nevertheless Obama, who won that vote, got 29 electoral votes." This is stating that the large states votes becomes one.

Also, when this talks about how it requirs a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal is also a good thing. it says in this passage," No region has enough electoral votes to elect a president." Again this is saying that none of our votes get uncounted for, we are all counted as one.

Some might say that they dont know where their votes are going to but when you think about they are all going to the same place in one factor.
