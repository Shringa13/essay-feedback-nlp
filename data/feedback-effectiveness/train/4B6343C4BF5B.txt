Dear,Senator

I think we should in take concideration in the next few years about changing are election to popular vote. I feel that are state would benefit in a positive way with the way that popular vote is set up. looking at the  past history the electoral college is not benefiting us in a positive direction. i qutoe this from the article "over 60 percent of voters would pefer a direct election"with that being said lets look at the cons of the electoral college.

To begin with the electoral college system the people like me dont get to vote for president i have to vote for someone else to vote for me in that i feel like my vote doesnt count because what happens if i vote for a elector and he doesnt go for my person to win. That just makes me feel dumb then if the elector does vote for the same person asme its not really even final becuase that vote doesnt go towards the president it goes toward the state elector and its basically there choice. another con in the electoral college system is that the same fiasco in 2000 will break out again. were the legislatures are responsible for picking electors and they dont take in to concideration of other people votes. the con that could mostly impact america is a tie in the electoral vote. another reason the electoral college is an stupid way to vote is that the big states get better privelges than the smaller states they out rule the smaller states. Its final the electoral college is unfair outdatedand irrational.

the only reasons the electoral college is alive now is the cetainty outcome,everystates president,swing states,runoff elections .run off electionsn means basically  there will never be a blow out in the voting polls it will always be compitive with that being said with the presidents trying to run for president the will actually try to reach the peoples needs to meet there satisfactory. the swing states is sayiong that there one state isnt going to decide the whole election.
