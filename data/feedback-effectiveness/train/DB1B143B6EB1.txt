Technology has become a large part of our daily lives. We rely on it for communitcation, information, and various different things. Now, scientist want to bring computers that can read our facial expressions into the classrooms. People believe this technology will shape our future as students and this is why they are wrong.

Bringing computers that read our facial expressions into classrooms is an invasion of privacy for students. If a computer is able to see our expressions while we are reading articles or doing video surgery, this means that our computers are recording our every move.

"Using video imagery, the new emotion-recognition software tracks these facial movements - in a real face." This quote from the article states that our computers are watching us to see if we are pleased or unsatisfied with what we are looking at. They believe this new technology is a great idea but they do not realize people can hack into these systems. When hackers get into these systems, they can watch you and what you do, which is invasion of privacy.

We already have amazing technology that we use on a day to day basis. In my opinion, there is no reason why students should need a computer to read their facial expressions inside of the the classroom.
