Dear Principal, I believe that having time to use our cell phones is prior to our learning. What if someone's family member is pregnant and goes into labor during class? Would you deprive them of getting updates via text? I think if its the right circumstance you should be able to use your phones. Like if your math teacher runs out of calculators and you don't get one, you should be able to use the calculator on your phone. Maybe music calms you down and you have some on your phone and you are too stressed about some personal problem and they cant focus on they're work, this has actually happened to me. One time i had a substitute teacher named TEACHER_NAME, he would let us talk, text, listen to music, and now he's banned from the premises and i can tell you i got more work done in 30 minutes then i could've in a day of that class. I think if were allowed some leeway than we will be happy with our teachers so we can actually work on our work. Some kids are so shy that they don't even talk to their teachers and those kids might think that the class is too hard or the teachers are mean or something if we were allowed phones out in class he might feel comfortable. I could see where there would be some trouble with kids who simply don't care so there should be some sort of points system where you have to have a certain amount of points to get the privilege of phones. What's the point of being at school if you're not comfortable.
