The author did a great job supporting his/her previous statements. The author used many examples and real facts to back up the explanation of why we should keep studying and trying to get to Venus. Venus is a complicated planet, with many features that are not imaginable. Although we haven't made many big discoveries about Venus itself, we will still continue to learn, look at, and love everything about it.

The author stated that Venus is extremely dangerous do to the crazy temperatures, radioactivity, and absurdly high atmospheric pressures. "On the planetÂ’s surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet"(The Challenge of Exploring Venus 3). This quote represents everything previously stated. It speaks of the high temperatures and the atmospheric pressure on Venus' surface and atmosphere. "Also notable, Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solar system, even though Mercury is closer to our sun"(The Challenge of Exploring Venus).

This quote shows another fact that'll help back up other statements. It talks about how Venus actually has the hottest surface in our solar system.

In concluson, Venus should continue to be studied and should be understood by everyone. After reading this passage, it's hard not to see the beauty of life. After years and years of studying and learning, maybe one day we'll make a ground-breaking discovery about Venus, and we'll be able to inhabit the planet somehow, along with having a better understanding of our solar system.
