Seeking Multiple Opinions Helps Make Better Choices

Many people seek several opinions for advice because it helps them piece together the ideas they get and create a better way of going about something. It lets them see multiple ways of doing something while also allowing them to separate the good advice from the bad advice. This is why people get advice from the people they trust. The person seeking advice knows that they will put thought into the advice they give them.

Everyone thinks differently and has their own perspective on everything. This is why many people have very different ideas and opinions. Listening to another person's opinions can open your mind to the different ways of doing something. It can also help some people to grow as a person and be able to take their own advice.

In order to get the most well rounded advice a person must ask a variety of different people. Often times someone will only ask one person for advice, making their point of view limited. They are only getting one opinion, and aren't able to see how other people interpret what they want to know.

Another reason why a person may ask several people for advice is because there are many people who give bad advice. Unfortunately some people don't want to help and only want to focus on themselves. So they give a person poor advice in hopes that the person will stop asking. Then there are some people who are ignorant to the topic.

They don't know enough about the topic to give someone proper advice. Usually these types of people don't have malevolent intentions, they just don't know the right things to say. Asking many people helps to separate the good advice from the bad advice people give. It also can help to find the people in someone's life that care about their well being. Which, in the future, will help them make better decisions on later things, because they will know who gives the best advice.

Lastly, hearing several opinions can narrow down what not to do. If many people say to not do something then the person knows that majority of people agree it will only do them harm. It is the same for the things a person should do. If many people have the same advice then they know that it's the right thing to do. Indecisiveness is prevalent in many people. Having several voices present should enforce the person to make a decision. Someone can also put together all of the advice they get and find the common denominator of the advice. Making the person self assured about following the advice people gave, because so many of their peers thought the same way. You can tweak all of the advice to create a better idea or a stronger piece of advice. Usually your own advice is best for yourself, so adding other people's advice to your own can help you make a greater choice.

In all, asking more people gets someone more advice. It makes a person feel sure of their decisions and more confident about the choice they will make. In the end when they go through with their choice they will get it done more precisely than if they had not gotten advice. However, there are times where finding the right advice is hard but, asking several people can help determine what the most positive decision is.
