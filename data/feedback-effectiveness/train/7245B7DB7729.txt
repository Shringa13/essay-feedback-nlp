Dear Principal,

Community service can be good for people with spare time but others have no time for something such as this.

Like if you play sports and have practice from right after school to about 5:30 and then you try to do community service.

In my opinion students should not be required to do community service but every few weeks we should have a sign-up sheet for a certain service that people may participate in.

I personally have no time for community service because of all the homework I have and then on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays I help my dad coach my brothers soccer team.

Maybe in the beginning or end of the year when nothing is going on everyone could do some kind of community service to help out.

Most students whether it be in school or out of school have so much going on or just don't care about doing community service that they stay home and play video games or watch television.

Community service could be as much as making sure that when you roll your car windows down that no trash in your car flies out.

Most kids help the community in little ways like this and don't even now that they are but it makes a big difference.

Some people love to do community service and every minute they have free they take there time to help somebody.

If you have nothing to do after school then you may need to do some community service so that the community can be clean or tutor some kids, because it can all make a difference in your community.

If I had time on my hands then I would do community service but I do so much already I have no time at all.

On the other hand making kids do community service no matter what could be a good thing.

It would show them that there is much more than just being a kid and trying to get away with stuff.

Like every month the school could pick one service to make a certain grade do and then we could make a huge difference.

So then again maybe we should do community service.

Sincerely,
