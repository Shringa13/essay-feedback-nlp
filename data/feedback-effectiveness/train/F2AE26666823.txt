The challenges of exploring Venus can be worthly pursuit but dangers can be presented. One postive example of

Venus is called the evening star is one the brightest ponits of light in the night sky making it simple for even an amater stragazer to spot. The reason we explore or visit other plants its because the human curioity will likely lead us to many other discovers. A not so postive example is just imagine living on Venus and not having electronics lets put an eample just imagine exposing a cell phone or tablet to acid or heat capable of melting tin. Second Venus is called the earth twins. why do you ask? Earth in terms of density and size and occasionally the closet in distance too. Earth and Venus and Mars are other planetary neighbor who they orbit the sun at different speeds.

The difference in speed from earth to venus is that sometimes we are closer to mars and other times to venus is close to earth. A negavtive reason Venus has a thick atomosphere of almost 97 perecent carbon dioxide blankets venus. Another challange is that that the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in venus atomshere. The conditions are far more extreme than anything humans encounter on Earth. Thrid reason Venus has the hottest surface temperture of any planet in our planet ,even though Mercury is closer to our sun. The dangers ir presents is the high pressure and heat,venus geology and weather present additionl impediments like erupting volcanoes,powerful earthquakes and frequent lighting. A reason why humanity is exploring venus because it once have been earth like planet in our planet. A long time ago Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life. This shows the dangers Venus has and the if it worthly to discovered.
