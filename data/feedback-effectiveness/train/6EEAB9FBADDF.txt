I think that the Face on Mars is just a natural landform.

Faces on the Earth in common to happend because of lava. "The Martian is simlar around the America West". It can also be a "lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa adout the some height as the Face on Mars" according to the last paragraph.

But we never found lava on Mars? Well we will look for it and how do you think it got on there. And if there is not lava of Mars? Then its might just be a natural land form like mountains on Earth. What if people lived there and got covered in dust like material? I don't think there could be humans of Mars because of the lack of oxygen,food,water and bactreia so there in on way peopel could live on Mars.

These are some reasons that I think that the Face on mars is just a natural landform.
