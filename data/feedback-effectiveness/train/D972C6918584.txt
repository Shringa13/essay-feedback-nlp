Dear Principal,

Tick tock what is that noise, that is the sound of the clocks going off to switch classes and the time for all cell phones to start going off.

I believe that all cell phones should be aloud at school for many reasons, but a few reasons would have to be because what if someone had an emergency out of the classroom or in the bathroom you would obviously need a phone or something for them to call for help. Also i think that all students should have cell phones no matter what because some students might go home with friends or go home by themselves, and all parents need to get in touch with their children to make sure they made it home safe!

Students get there phones taking up so much during school because they either get a phone call or a text message during class because they forget to turn their phones off or they just leave them on vibrate and that is not allowed. I think if they made a phone policy to use them only for emergency's or specific purposes then we would probably not have as big of problems as we have been having.

I agree with policy 1 that they should allow students to bring phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times, as long as their turned off during class time. I think if every student in middle school wrote a paper to a principal saying they would only use their cell phone's for emergency's only then I believe that they might would allow them to stay on and stay with them at school.

I hope that each principal at each middle school will get this letter and look back and think that if each student listens to this and follows these proper directions and don't use there phones during class then they might make this a rule to have cell phone's back!
