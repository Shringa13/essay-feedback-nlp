Dear state senator,

I belive  we should change the way for election .Under the electoral colloge system voters vote  for a state of electors who turn elect the president, and that not right . Say if i were to buy a big pizza ,and it was cut into 4 big pices and 8 small. The 8 people ate there pizza but it didnt really matter but when the the other 4 people ate there pizza it did . ok say if i weree to have a even pizza  4/4  . one half where the people and the other half was the big people in charge so u can say....no matter what the people say its only going to have like 25/100 effect.

After reading a text its says "when you vote for a presidential candidate you're actually vothing for a slate of electors''. other reason u should change the electon collge is lack of democratic pedigree are all reason that this is not reliable. despite its almost happing its not really a good way to do it. am  give i an  exaple Obama recived 61.7 percent of the  electoral vote compared to only 51.3 precent of the popular votes.
