Have you ever wondered if the famous face on mar's is just there naturally or was it put there by aliens well it was actually just there naturally. Scientist's have proven that this famous face from magazines and once starred in a hollywood film is just a natural landform in a region of mar's called Cydonia.

This face is just a natural landform and how we know its a natural landform is because the article states, " It's just a huge rock fromation, Formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth". It's not an alien monument It's just a natural landform on mar's.

So that is why this iconic face of the 1970's and 80's is just part of the planet mar's itself and wasn't put there by another living speicies on mar's like aliens It's just some shadow's that come together a little bit to give the illusion of eye's, a nose, and a mouth in the region of Cydonia. This face was also discovered in the late 1970's specifically 1976.
