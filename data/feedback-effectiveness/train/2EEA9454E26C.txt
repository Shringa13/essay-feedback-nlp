Yes i think it fair to say that because i think every student can make a B or a C to play any kind of sports that they want to play because if you have like a F or D you shouldn't beable to play you shouldn't beable to to play that game or something because it not fair to everyone that they cant play an the game but it is fair to the people who get F&D because they shouldn't be making bad grades they should be making good grades if they want to play an that sport it has nothing to do with ever body just you an principal an teacher why you get the grades you get maybe because it the way you acted an the way you play aronud..... And maybe the kids that want to play a sport cant play because of the way they behavior is or the way they talk to grew people......
