Dear Principal,

I'm writing this letter to inform you on my thoughts and positions on requiring students to perform community service. I would first like start by saying that community service is a great thing. without a good community and those who help we have no community. I agree that students should be required to perform community service. Community service teaches the youth of the importance of having a strong community. It also teaches how to take care of our community when we grow up. Another strong point is to give back. As kids we get everything we want without giving back. Lets show the adults how well rounded are communities youth is. By doing things as simple as community car pooling or just picking up garbage we decrease our pollution in the air which would make this a safer place to live. students such as myself should be assumed to help the community out, also we shouldn't be rewarded with material things for helping our community. Reading to kindergartner's should warm anybodies heart. Knowing that we made some sort of a difference in our community is reward enough. Principal I think I've made my point clear. Are youth should have to perform community service. It wouldn't take away all our free time and it would help our community in so many ways.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
