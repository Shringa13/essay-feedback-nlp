Have you ever looked at someone and you wasnt sure what thier emotion was?

i think what Nick did was amazing making a facial coding system to tell what thier feeling. This article is very valuble i believe because this is something serious yo me you could say your happy but you really won't be but with the system anybody could know your real and true feelings.

i get why some people dont tell their real feelings because they might not want them to see them down. i can gret that but at the same time you could get help anything can happen to you while your down and it could be really helpful or maybe go to a consoulor to talk to or anything.

if people would just try it out they might enojy and like it but i know most of them well not enjoy or like it at all.

it well also tell all your emotions for explain in the artclle it said "she's 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearfu; , and 2 percent angry"

then Nick tells us how it works " the process begins with a computer constructs a 3-d computer model of the face all 44 major muscles in a model must move likle human muscles."
