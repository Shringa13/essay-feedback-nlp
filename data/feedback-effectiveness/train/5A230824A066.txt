The technology to identify human emotion in my trance of thought its stupid. I don't think this would be helpful in a classroom because it would just be a waste. in my thoughts i think it would be a waste because some people that are having a bad day might just want to be left alone and not talk about there problems to people. The computer might be able to detect the persons emotions by characterlise there facial muscles by the expression movements but the student might be annoyed that it does this all the time and doesnt like it. In the article it says that " Dr. Huang observes that artists such as da Vinci studied human anatomy to help them paint facial muscles precisely enough to convey specific emotions." here it says that Dr. Huang studies different artists and there paintings and how some showed how they used there emotion and some didn't. Its a bad idea to modify a computer to read peoples emotions because when a kid is doing there homework and the kid is bored the computer is going to detect that the kid is bored from doing his/her homework and put a add with a video game and the kid is going to get distracted and fail the assingment.
