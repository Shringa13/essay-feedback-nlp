I'm against this technology that reads your emotions because I mean who really cares what other people are feeling, unless you're close to them. Some people might not want there feelings to be read because its a matter or privacy. It's also just plain dumb like instead of focusing on this technology, that reads peoples emotions work on something more important like finding a better source of fuel, for the world thats good for us but also for nature or how to stop deforestation stuff like that.

But I slighlty do think this is somewhat a good idea like its says in paragraph 6 "Imagine a computer that knows when you're happy or sad". For example if you smile when a web ad appears on your screen a similar ad might follow. But if you frown the next ad will be different "A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored "Most human communication is nonverbal including emotional communication" noted Dr. Huang "So computers need to understand that too. The only part I agree with is that it would be good for school computers to see if you had gotten confused with a certain problem that has happened and it could offer help or request help for you.

There for I support and don't support this technology because we could use this technology for good things or just use them for dumb things like recognizing The Mona Lisas emotions like who really cares.
