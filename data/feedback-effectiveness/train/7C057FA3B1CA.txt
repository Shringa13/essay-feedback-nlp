Dear Senator,

What have Richard NIxon, Jimmy Carter, and Bob Dole, all in their time agreed on?

The Electoral College.

The Electoral College is not a place, its a process.

By the passage of source 1 , the founding fathers established the Electoral CollegeÂ  as a compromise, between election of the President by a vote in Congress and the election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens. Keeping the Electoral College is important.

Having an Electoral College is a safe way to ensure that everyone get to envoice there opinion. For example, the Electoral college avoids problems and tries to fix eveything so that everyone can be happy. Many people don't like the fact of the Electoral College because they feel that their vote doesn't count. But really every one's vote does. When the American citizens vote and there is a tie between the two candidates then thats another time when we use the Electoral College.

Each Candidate running for President in each state has his or her own group of electors. Each party (democratic or republican) selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee. I strongly believe that we should keep the Electoral College as any force of back-up when it comes down to voting!
