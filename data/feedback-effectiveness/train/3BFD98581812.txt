in the artical the autoer shows how they would like to see venus get explored dispite the harsh condisons and odd wether. the autoer gives many resons why they would like to see venus such as how it is earths twin, flying over it with a blimp or jet of some kind, as well as a mecanical computer.

so the authoer states that venus is eraths twin this would a huge milestone and would be amazing. one of many resons would be to use it for the study of earth and our sun.

the next way would be a bilmp or jet of some kind that would fly over venus at an altutude that is safe for use. this is however a bad way to get there for the astronuts would be there for a short time becuse of fuel cost and coservaton. as well as there would be no real way to test the surfuse of venus from there ass you could not get to the surfuce.

and the last way to get there is by sneding a mecalical computer this would give use amazing resalts. but a the cost of developing a computer that the last time these were largly used was in the 1940's wolud be a fotune and they left that out for they relly whant to go.

the from the artical how the auther relliy wants to go to venus so they gave us the resons how it is earths twin, flying over it with a blimp or jet of some kind, as well as a mecanical computer. so in conclusen the auther relly whant to go to venus
