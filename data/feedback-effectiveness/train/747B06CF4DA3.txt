This technology is valuble to the the classroom in my opinion. I think that because it's good to calculate someone's feelings. The part that got me the most was when 'A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored.' Dr. Huang predicts, I feel that's a good idea because some students are afraid to ask for help in front of the class. They said

'the mona lisa demonstration is really intended to bring a smile to your face' which is also a good thng. " Theory of emotion , moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotion, but also may even help produce them' which is also good.

I feel like this would be great thing for science. You can do great, fun projects with this at school. You can use it with your friends. Knowing someones emotions without having to ask is a good thing. When feeling sad and nobody knows it but then technology comes and someone knows and they help you be happy again, or become friends. You can help people become more happy by knowing they're sad and make them smile. You can know what your friendis feelings or your boyfrind/girlfriend. Let's say you don't want to talk about how you're feeling so the technology helps you speak without having too.

We can have 'empathy' states the article so we might not have to explain ourselfs and explain how we are feeling about a certian soution. You won't have to keep your feelings inside forever. It's a good way to learn about science of emotions even said it in the article. I also think it's a good thing thing to have around kids/teens older people since technology is the furture. This how I feel about the Facial Action Coding System.
