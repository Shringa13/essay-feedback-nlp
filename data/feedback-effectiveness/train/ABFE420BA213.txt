Dear Principal

I believe that this could be a good decision but may also be a bad one as well.

Many of the students that care only for there sports or other activities and that don't do very well in school will keep up with there work only because they want to do that one sport or other activity. This might separate the people who are really determined with there academic achievements and the people who only want to play there sport or activities. The people that only want to play there sport may drop out because being able to do that thing will be just another step harder ,while the people that want to do good in school will continue to do good.

It might be a good thing as well.

The people who ,not only want to play sports or other activities but are willing to do good in school will do better in school because of the worry that they might not be able to do this anymore. So this decision may benefit the school in a way.

In all I know that this is your decision to make and I will only suggest that u make sure that you look at the schools benefit as a whole. Thank you for taking the time to read my letter.
