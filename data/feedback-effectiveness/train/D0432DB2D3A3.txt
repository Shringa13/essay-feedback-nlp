In my opinion i think we should change voting to popular vote. The reason why is because the governmennt sometimes performs certain actions that they think is good for the people when at the end of it its really not its just for the government to get more money. So when it comes to the president of the United States of America I think we should change it to popular vote.

Because the electoral college might mess up dicisions and its a really bad thing to mess up the dicision of who is the president of our country. In the past we have had many bad presidents bacause of mess ups in electoral colleges or uneven amounts of electoral voters. Also bradford plumer staes that in last election 60% of voters prefered a direct election and not an electoral college vote. Also votes would be settled much easier because there would a one in a million chance of getting votes tied and the people would have it there way.

If we were to keep the electoral college there will countinue to have untrustworthy presidents or irisponsible presidents like obama,george bush jr, or ronald reagen. The downside to having popular vote would be that if a candidate were to convice the American people to follow his commands like Adolf Hitler did and lead them blindly then that would be a major problem. But the constitution has rights and amendments that doesnt allow for those types of incidents to occur.

Therefore those are my reasons for wanting to change the system of electoral voting to be changed to popular voteing.
