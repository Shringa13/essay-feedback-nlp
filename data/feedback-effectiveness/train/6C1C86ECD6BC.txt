Dear Principal,

I would rather take a joint to the community service. Helping people could be better for the world so it will cause less stress and have a better environment. Students should require to do this service to let them know they're doing something very helpful to the community. By being helpful you can get an award for future use or you can be very proud of yourself and let other people around you be proud of you too.

Ex. 1: Cleaning up trash is a helpful way to serve community service. This will make the environment a cleaner place, and also safer. No animal, fishes, and humans should be injured if we clean up the trash and never liter again.

Ex. 2: Tutoring someone who is struggling with a certain project, homework, etc; can really help with their education. They could have a better grade if someone offered to tutor to.

Teaching the people who are younger and less knowledgeable will let them know what's going on, or what to do for future use.

Ex. 3: Making a charity for the homeless people. Knowing if there's someone with a family who is out on the streets trying to be alive is just sad. People can do concerts, plays, and just washing people cars could help earn money for he charity. By doing this, you could be helping lots of other people who needed shelter.

Ex. 4: Recycling is a way to also help the community. There's tons and tons of water bottles that have been used and not been thrown correctly in the right bin. By recycling , the stuff that are able to recycle can be used over and over again. Trees could be saved by recycling so we don't to kill the animal's home and let them be homeless.

Mostly the main reasons on helping the community is to make the people around you feel very helped. You would also feel very appreciated knowing there's people who will also help you back. Which is why; I would rather be helping the community than laying down do nothing when there's something needed to be changed.
