Dear, state senator we should keep the Electoral College because its better and its unique. Its better because the Electoral College consists of the selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for Presdident and Vice President, and the counting of the electoral votes by Congress. The Electoral College consists of 538 electors. Each candidate running for President in your state has his or her own group of electors.

The Electoral College is really a progress. Its also better because you can help choose your your state's electors when you vote for President becuse when you vote for your candidate you are actually voting for your candidate's electors. They are generally chosen by the candidate's political party. Its better in alot of ways.

The Electoral College is unique in many ways. The founding fathers established it in the Constitution as a Compromise between election of the President by a vote for President and Vice Preident, and the counting of the electoral votes by Congress. Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the preident, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president.
