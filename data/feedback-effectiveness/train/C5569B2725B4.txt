For me a car is very important , because if you have a car you can move to other places that you want . But not only that , if you have an emergency you can go rapidly,or in time . But this is not a facility in all countries and exist much problems with that , for example in Germany the street parking ,driveways and home garages , this are generally forbidden ,new district on the outskirts of Freiburg, near the French and Swiss. but in Vauban's streets are completly car free , this is so good , but with a limit ,like  except the main thoroughfare , where the tram to downtown Freiburg runs.

In conclucion:"As a result , 70 percent of Vauban's families do not own cars , and 57percent sold a car to move here". And this is in source 1.

In source 2, in some countries exist prblems with traffic in the strees. One example is Paris ," 4,000 drivers were fined , according to Reuters ,27peoplehad their cars impounded for their reaction to the fine. But the traffic go down 60 percent in the capital of France , after 5 days of intensifying smog . But of course  some countries have more that others , for example Paris typically has more smog than others europrean capitals , "Paris had 147 micrograms of particulate matter ,per cubir meter compared with 114 in Brussels and 79.7 in London , Reuters found .

In Bogota, Colombia one day is celebreted as Car free day , but in once  year occur somthing different , millions of colombians hiked , biked , skated or took buses to work during this day , leaving the streets without traffic jams .

Paks and sports center also have bloomed throughout the city , uneven pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad , smooth sidewalks ,  and others , restrictions have dramatically cut traffic . In conclucion the day without cars is part of an improvement campaign that began in Bogota in the mid 1990s .
