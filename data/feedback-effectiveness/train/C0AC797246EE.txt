Dear state senator,

I will like to argue about the Electoral College.The voters vote for the presidant,but they are just voting for a slate of electors that they can elect the presidant.They are called disaster factor .The disaster factor got the name from the 2000 fiasco.The question we are all worrying about is what if it happened again?We dont want to go through it again,we might not get lucky as we did from the 2000 fiasco.

What if we have an electoral tie like in 1968.There was 41,971 votes that could of gotten deadlocked the election.Its unfair for us voters because of the winner-takes-all system.Candidates don't spend time in states of them knowing there is no chance of winning.We need to put fate of the presidency in the hands of swing voters.There isn't alot of basis in reality.

It's against direct elections that are spurious.We need to go with Bob Doyle accusation of that we need to abolish the Electoral College.Everybody is arguing about the Electoral College.Everybody thinks its unfair,outdated,and irrational.Listen to the people,listen to what they have to say about this.Let's change the Electoral College by making it better for us and Congress.

Thank You

From,
