Dear, senator

As a student learning more and more about the world we live in I understand that there has been problems deciding weather or not congress should continue to use the electoral college the elect our nationals new or future presidents. I believe that the race for presidency in just a huge game and the electoral college is just a great tool that is used in this game to find a faster way to win. But some people probably don't even know how to use it which is why the problem was arroused.

Taking aways the electoral college is like playing a game that have no obsticles nor opponents to challege you. Nothing in life is fare or cheep and by only using popular votes is to cheat the candidates of the true experience of running for what they want. If you or me were to run for president I'm sure we would want to have the oppertunity to use the electoral college to our advantage.

I believe the electoral chollege should continue to be used and nothing hsould change about how our stong nation selects our leaders because with change comes new obsticals and with those leeps and jumps comes errors. To change the way something has been done for such a long time would be like asking to distroy something and rebiuld it all the way back from the begining. I think that as a nation these problems are nothing to us, Why creat a big problem out of a simpler problem when we can just let it be and work our way arround the problems we face together.

Sincerely, Solomon       Â
