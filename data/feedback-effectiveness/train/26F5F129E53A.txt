Dear my state senator,

I would like to keep the Electoral College. I think it would be better for the people. Voters in presidential elction are people who want to express a politcal preference rather than people who think that a single vote may decide an election.

The Electoral Collge, ancachronism, a non-demoocratic  method of selecting a president that should be [overruled] by declaring the candidate who recieves the most popular votes the winner. The Electoral College method is not democatic in a modern sense. It is the electors who elect the president, not the people. When you vote for a presidential candiate your actully vting for a slate of electors. Our fouding fathers established it.

Certanity of Outcome

Everyone's President swing States

Big Stats

Avoid Run-Off Elections

A magority of 270 elctors votes are reqiured. 3 Electors and treated like a state of purpose. Running for president has their own group  of elcetors. Help choose the states electors when you vote for canidate. Governer prepares a Certificate of Ascertanaiment.

Thanks for your understanding.
