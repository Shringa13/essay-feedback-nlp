In the article the author states,"Venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors" meaning getting humans to another planet, in particular Venus, will be extraordinary research and could lead humankind to staying for many more centuries. If we find that we can live on Venus with this research, then why shouldn't we. There were a lot of failed missions to the moon and now look what we know about it. We learned so much because people decided to risk their lives in order for us to learn more about the universe. We can do so much good with the world and if we have the choice of trying to go to Venus, shouldn't we try? The only way we know we're going to fail is if we don't try and not trying would be a diservice to people. Besides, what if we get to make friends with aliens?
