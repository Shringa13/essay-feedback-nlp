I thinks the new technology called the Facial Action Coding System enbles computers to indenify humans emotions is good things like what the author says on paragraph 3 because that can helps the people if the computers can indentify people emotions like if they happy or sad and if it can makes people feels better if the computers help the people like taking them to a websites where they can read a story or others like playing games, listen to music and watching news that make them relaxing.

Also I thinks what the sciencetists says on paragraph 1 "Developing better ways for humans and computers to communicate", this means that they said like it better for all people if they developing a software that can recognize emotions.

Another good things about the emotion recongnition like what it says on paragraph 4 because the software can also recognize faces on a pictures.

If the new computer software that can tells people emotions, sciencetists should make them more valuable like adding more news features to it and that will make more people to like them.
