This article is about a small town near the french and swiss borders its name is Vauban. Vauban ha a unique community they have no cars!. yeah thats right no cars there is a no automobile law in this small town which makes a lot of people like the mother of two ms. Heidrun walter. she says that she is "much happier this way because when i had a car i was always tense". people could walk down the street and not worry about wether or not a person is going to lose control of their car and smash into them or even worse.

In 2006 the united states and other areas started to try these things and they called it "smart planning". car ownership is allowed but there are only two parking areas-large garages at the edge of the development where a car-owner buys a space for $40,000, along with a home. vauban, home to 5,500 residents within a rectangular square mile, is the most advanced experiment in low car suburban life. "All of our development since World War II has been centered on the car, and that will have to change," said david goldberg.
