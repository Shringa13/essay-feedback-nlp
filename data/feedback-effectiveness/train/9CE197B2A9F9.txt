Luke's point of view is convincing others to participate in the seagoing cowboys program. His experience with the program had opened up the world to him and he has experience some exiting events. As seen in paragraph 9 it says '', It opend up the world to him". It also says ''it made me more aware of people of other cuntries and there needs". I like that Luke had aggread to go on the trip and that he is engoing it after he broke his ribs because that means he has a good spirit. I did injoy this story and people shuld participate in the program.

Luke's participation in the progran hays allowed him to experince adventures and visits to many unique places. Such as when he saw the Acropolis in greesce was special. He also saw Europe and China. There took about two weeks to cross the Atlantic Ocean from the eastern coast of the United States and a month to get to China. Luke also saw Italy with streets of water. He is a lucky person to see those great places.

Luke is likes the program good all its good things. So i whould go and other people shuld to.
