You should participate in the Seagoing cowboys becuase you could visit alot of cool places.

you could go anywhere you wanted to.

Its also good if you like to help people.

If you love helping people then you should participate in this program.

another thing thats good about this program is that you can do it with a friend.

If you like to hangout with your friend alot then you should participate in this program.

Another thing great about the Seagoing cowboys is that if you like helping animals you should do it.

You get to take care of and look after all the animals on the boat. feeding and looking after animals is a great to do with a friend.

even if you dont like animals.

The seagoing cowboys program is an unbelivible opportunity for somebody to go across the ocean and see places people dont get to see everyday.

I had been to europe,china greece and have even crossed the ocean 16 times!

The favorite place ive been to was venice,Italy,a city with streets of water.

Theres also so many places you can go.

Ive been to China,Greece,Europe,Venice,italy and even crete.

There I toured an excavated castle.

This program is the perfect opportunity to visit any place you want to.

There are some flaws to this program.

Its very dangerous.

I almost slid off the boat in the middle of the night.

your also going to be in the ocean for hours until you reach your destination.

But all in the end its a really good program.
