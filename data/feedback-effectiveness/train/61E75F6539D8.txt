There are many bad reasons why you shouldn't go Seagoing. One reason is you can get killed and be letf there like Luke almost died. Next reason is it's not fit for everyone such as not everyone would like to do this task. The last reason is you don't earn any money from Seagoing i know its a opportunity of a lifetime but think about it.

The places you can go such as Europe now thats kind of odd. Of why you you would go in a cattle boat fulled with people you dont know. I'm not saying I would turn down that opportunity but I would think about it for awhile. You dont know where you going to be next you may get a hint or something i wouldn't know but it would be scary if it where myself doing this.

When would you get home? I would always ask myself this quistion if it were me on a cattle boat going to Europe .

Also what was the main reason why I took this opportunity. Was the main reason because it was opportunity of a lifetime. Think it over and find 3 main reasons why you took this opportunity.

I understand why Luck did what he did. What im trying im trying to say here is why he crossed the Atlantic Ocean 16 times and the Pacific Ocean twice to help people affected by World War II. What I dont unnderstand is what was his main reason.

To finish up my dissagrement of why someone like me or even you shouldent do this is, did he even help anybody becaue in the promt it didn't tell wither or not if he did. I would think that was that was the most important thing.
