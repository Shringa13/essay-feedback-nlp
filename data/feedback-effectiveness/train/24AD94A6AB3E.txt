Ill be sumerizing the article over venus and why it is not we can not step foot on this planet.

It says in paragraph two that venus is drapped in clouds and that the un manned ships that have been send did not last more that 2 hours. That is whay no man has ever steped foot on Venus. Venus is a chellenging planet the last time a space craft touched down was 3 decades. Beyond high pressureand heat, eupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightning strikesto probes seeking to land on its surface.

If Venus is so inhospitable why are scientists even discussing visits to its surface. Astronomers are fasinated by Venus because it may have been much like earth long ago. The planet has a surface of rocky sediments and includes familiar features such as vallies, mountains, and craters.

Striving to meet the challenge presented by venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the the planet itself. also because human curiosity will likelylead us into many equally intimidating endeavors. Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation.
