There are pros and cons for both whywe should keep and get rid of the Electoral college.

You are voting for the electors, not the president. Voters don't get to choose the electors. Some electors might even defy the wishes of the people who voted for them. There are 538 electoral votes, which is an even number so their could be a tie.

It is rare that eletors will defy the wishes of the voters, but it has happened. In 2000 Gore had a high percentage of the popular vote than electoral votes. This is so rare that the only other time that it happened was in 1888. Most states give electoral votes on a winner-takes-all basis, some split the votes a little bit, because of this there is a clear winner. In the case of electoral votes, no one region of the United States can win alone, so the votes are spread out. If presidential elections were decided directly by the popular vote than region favorites would be elected abd the rest of the voters would feel that they did'nt vote for the president that was elected. Presidential candidates are most likely to campaign in "swing states" that they know they cn win the electoral votes from. Voters in these states are most likely to pay close attention to both candidates, so the most thoughtful voters will get the most representation. The most populated states or the "big states" get the most electoral votes, meaning the states with the most people the the most representation. With the Electoral College you increase your chances of having a majority (fifty percent or more). While there can be a tie, this is rare.

Since there are good arguements on both sides, a decision has to be made after careful thought.
