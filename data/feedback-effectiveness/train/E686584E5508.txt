Eh, its cool, sorta but knowing me I really dont care about this facial action coding thing. I wanna find out the mood of the picture on my own. But its a cool thingy, the fact that you can find out what the person in a painting is feeling is insane. As Dr. Huang says in paragraph 4 "the facial expression for each emotions are universal," "even though individuals often show varying degrees of expression." and that you can also reproduce a smile is weird ( I never knew that was a thing).But yea FACs can show you what your mood(s) are in a picture just by scanning your facial parts. Muscles called orbiculariaris make crows feet around your eye, but in a false smile. the mouth is strectched sideways using zygomatic major and a different muscle, the riorius. So all the muscles can get the coding to scan your face and it'll tell you the percentage of the mood that you are in whether you're sad, mad, happy, bored, it will tell you all of that jazyy stuff.
