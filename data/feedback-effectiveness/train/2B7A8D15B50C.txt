The face on mars was first found by the spacecraft called Viking one and was cirling mars when it found the face. alot of people belive it is a real artifact. NASA has took more pictures to prove that it is infact not an artifact. People belive there just covering it up so pople wont know about it. But that is not true it would benifit NASA if it were an true artifact.

The face on mars is just a lndform because of the pictures we took we could not see and form of building structure. one thing that brings me to this conclusion is the rocks and shadows made it look and seem very real. The text states "...formed by shadows...". Tv and other things are what is drawing the attention to the matter andthey are whats broadcasting to the world that it is real. The text states " It starred in a hollywood film , appeared in books , magazines, radio talk shows..."

This brings me to the conclusion that infact it is not real but was made real by televison and other things. People just dontt wanna listen to the since behind it. If it where in fact real it would benifit NASA.
