Cars that drive them selves shouldn't be developed. These cars shouldn't be developed because the cars they have now aren't completely driverless. All the "driverless" cars now can't navigate through any work zones or car accidents. Only thing these cars can do is steer, accelerate, and brake by themselves. What good are they if they can't manuever through things by themselves?

If someone was texting and driving in their driverless car and they let their car take over and their driverless car failed to drive by itself and a accident occured who would be to blame? Would the driver or the creators of the car be at blame for the accident? Safety would be best achieved by alert drivers. There is going to have to be new laws will be needed to cover liability of an accident. They say "We have to interpret driving fun in a new way." What fun is driving if you can't do it manually? Driving is a previlage why let you're car take the previlage of you driving?

Fully driverless cars shouldn't be developed. The automatic steering, acceleration, and braking by themselves are okay for a car. But completely driverless? No us drivers can stick to driving cars manually. Not wanting to drive is pure laziness anyways. People should enjoy being able to drive. There's no reason to not enjoy driving.
