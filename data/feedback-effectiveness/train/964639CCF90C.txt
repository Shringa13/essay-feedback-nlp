How the author support his suggests that studying venus is a worthy pursuit despite the danger it presents is, venus is one of the brightest point of light in the night sky, making it simple for even an amateur stargazer to sopt.

Venus is the secoynd planet from our sun.

Venus is also referred to as Earth's twin, Venus is also the clostest planet in distance.

Venus is sometimes right around the coner in space terms, humas have sent numerous spacecraft to land in the cloud-draped world and no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours.

Venus has not been touch by any spaceship for more than three decades.

The article also said, "on the planet's surface, temperatures averge over 8-- degrees fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet. These conditions are far more extreme than anything humans encounter on earth; such an environment would crush even a submarine accustomed to diving in the deepest part of our oceans and would liquefy many metals."

At thirty-plus miles above the surface, temperatures would still be toasty at around 170 degrees Fahrenheit, but the air pressure would be close to that of sea level on Earth.

Solar power would be plentiful and radiation would not ecceed Earth levels. Not easy conditions, but survivable for humans.

These are the reasons why the author suggested that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it present.
