I think my principle should required some of my friends should perform community service because they need to learn what mistake's they've done.

One reason why i think my principle should required community service is, some people might not want to tutor at a elementary school because they don't like kids. It would be better for them to tutor because in the end they might have a chance to like kids and help them out. Another reason is, most of them would not want to be picking up litter, but it would be good for them to learn their consequences.

My last reason is, They should learn that it's not always easy in life to do what ever they want; it doesn't matter if its taking up space in their time. There are to many crazy people out in this world and we can't let them go thinking that what ever they've done is ok.

In conclusion, People must learn that what their doing might not get them far in life. It could be better for them and have a chance of making a good life. That is why my principle should required community service.
