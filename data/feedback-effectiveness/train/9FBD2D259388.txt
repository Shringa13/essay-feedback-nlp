Being able to detect how other people are feeling can be a satisfiying and critical thing to use or to know. When the historical and famous picture that was taken of Mona Lisa famouse painting with her smiling can be a miss lead consuption or an unexpected photo at the time. With the FACS it was able to detect Mona Lisa's expression through the photo. She was 83% happy, 9% disgusted, 6% fearful, and 2% angry. The FACS isnt able to detect what Mona Lisa was happy, upset, angry, disgusted or fearful at the time. The only thing it was able to capture are her feelings but not towards what she was feeling for.

Being able to know that the person that you are analizing can have certain emotion's towards you or towards others is a good thing. If you were to have a significant other or some one that you are intrested in is sending mix signal can be complicated and people wouldn't be able to tell, it can be usefull but, can also be a disadvatage. There are people who tend to be complicated when they aren't wanting to. It would be easy tp know if there were to be a detected FACS. But how would it be for sure that it was towards that one specific person. For instance in the Mona Lisa picture/painting.
