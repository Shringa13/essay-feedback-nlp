Many cause of limited car usage tends to have less people on the streets. Near the French and Swiss borders ; streets and driveways and home garages were not allowed for free parking. It forced people to park in places where it was usually crowded. Most people did not like the parking rules. They either rode their bikes or walked back and forth to get to their destination. Later after that, many people were very upset with the parking rules, that alot of them decided to sell their car so they could park wherever and that had opened spaces for multiple cars to transpass the roads at the same time.

Same thing in Bogota, Columbia but the problem they had, was the pollution in the air. Columbians rode on buses with other people because the believed it was safer than being in a car and getting in an accident. Paris had the same problem, except they were fined to be driving. About 4,000 drivers were fined and others cars were to be impounded for arguing about being fined.

I think the better way for the car problems, is to have all people discuss the problems and explain what is best for other people. The solution near French and Swiss border is to let people park wherever they like and Columbia to clean up their pollution so they can live through fresh and safer enviroment.
