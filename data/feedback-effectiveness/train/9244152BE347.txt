I would argue in favor of keeping the electoral college because its bests to vot eby what the people want in able to keep a good country. I also think that if people werent allowed to vote how would the main leaders know whats the right and what is the wrong.

To start off , due to the passage ''Electoral college'' is a process in which the founding fathers established in the constitution as a compromise election of the president by congress and qualified citizens! NOT the leaders! If your want to run for president your main goal is to get people to follow you with impression and facts.

Each presidential election occurs every four years. Candidates enter in election competing against each other,'' the people'' watch if the candidate will be worth a president. Candidates will be eliminated one after another till there is only one winner.

Without the electoral college how would the people know if the president is trustworthy to the country, mainly people just want someone who is willing  to make the right changes. Like i said the leader's main goal is to get people to agree  and make them think that you are worth for the job. No one will appreciate someone making the laws without people agreeing the people would be furious and the word freedom wouldnt exsist anymore in the country. Freedom is all about peoples rights! Electoral college is a main process that is need to be able to make freedom for the citizens.
