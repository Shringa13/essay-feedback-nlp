Dear Principal,

I would like to tell you about how I think about doing community service. The reason I wanted to tell you about this is because I understand that some students would like to do community service and not others. In my opinion I think there should be a reason why some of the students want to do community service and not others. If the students that want to do community service can do that. If there is only a small group of people than it would not be a good way to have the work done. Please consider this and if you don't like this than it will be fine to me. My other reason is not everyone would like to pick up liter. It might not be what students want to do during there free time. I understand that your the principal of this school and not every principal would consider this opinion because you believe that everyone should do community service. I all so understand that it is very important to do community service around the school and you can learn many things from doing community service and I also like to tell you that there should be a list of places that there going to do service at.

Sincerely ,

Your student at SCHOOL_NAME
