Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I think that we should be able to have our phones in school during lunch and free periods. The reason is what if you had a medical emergency? and didn't have the phone number of that parent?. The policy's you made were very good and if we were aloud to have our phones in school it would make everyone a lot more happy. The only bad thing to this is that everyone knows that the students keep there phones on and the interruption to the class would be aggravating. I'm not saying that having phones during free periods and lunch is a bad thing but it may be in some situations. To be specific they might text during a test or maybe in the middle of class and its embarrassing not only to them but the teacher. The class may think its funny but some people just find it aggravating if this does happen i think that the students phone should be taken away.

If you do accept this policy i think that you should do some sort of phone check just make five or ten minutes for them to check the phones, or even take the phones from the students and then give them back to them before lunch and during the free periods. The reason i like this policy is because we are teenagers and for some people there phone is there lifeline. But for others they have a phone for "Emergency's"

only which is not always the case. Thank you for taking a moment of your time and reading this.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
