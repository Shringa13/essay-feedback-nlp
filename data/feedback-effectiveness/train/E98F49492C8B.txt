Dear Principle,

I think that your fist policy is the best because if kids don't bring their phones to school then well they are not be able to call for help during a emergency like if the power went out or if the teacher is gone and there is a break in or if some staff member needs medial treatment and the power is out or if school gets out and a friend ask if you can come over after school. If you chooses the other on people are still going to bring their phones to school anyway so why not let them have it at school just have rules for them not consequences.

Maybe if you let them more people will listen and not get in as much trouble. If people start to listen then well people won't get suspended as much. Now if you choose the second policy then people will not listen and bring there phones to school and you would just be suspending kids who just brought their phone to school. You would have a lot more suspicions or detentions.

If the first policy is chosen then you wouldn't have to keep nagging kids to put away their cell phones or stay all night and wait for parents to come pick up their kids cell phone.

If you pick the first policy the kids will be much happier and the parents happier they don't have to go pick up their kids phone. So please pick policy one. If you pick policy one then the kids will most likely like their principle and not hate her.

Sincerely,
