Dear Principal,

I am writing this letter to inform you that requiring all students to perform community service is a great idea. Even though other students may not like it I'm behind it 100 percent. The students who don't like it say "it takes too much time away from what they need or want to do", but in truth these are the lazy failing students that don't want to do anything in life. Even so there are students who would love the idea and would go for it. So I strongly urge you not to fall for teenage peer pressure. I can assure you that the kids who find community service "boring" or "a waste of time"

will soon see that performing community service will not only help the community, but inspire the world to do the same. Community service can maybe even lead to a greener tomorrow. So please Principal don't think twice about not having all students perform community service.

sincerely, very concerned student
