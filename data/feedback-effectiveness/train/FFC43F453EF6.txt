Senador first I want to say that I dissagree with the idea of the Electoral college becouse the people needs vote for the president that they want"that's democrastic". One of the reasons is that the Electoral College is unfair,outdated and irrational. The Electoral College is widely regarded as an anachorsims,not democratic method of selecting a president that ought to oberruled by declaring the candidate who recieve the most popular votes the winners. Its entirely possible that the winner of the electoral vote will not win the nation popular vote. There's a few reasons for retainig the Electoral College despite its lack of democratic pedigree: the first one is that a dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College vote is possible ,but it's possible,but it's likely that a disputate over the popular vote. Other is that the Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal. The Electoral College avoids the problem of elections in wich no candidate recieves a majority of the votes cast. For all that reasons and more I think that you need put off the Electoral College,and let the people pick for the presidents that they want.
