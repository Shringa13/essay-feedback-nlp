I favor in to changing election by popular vote because it would be more fair to the people who are running and it would be quicker to decide who is president.

I think its better to be elected by popular votes because people actually like the person for a reason and actually listening to what that person is saying and actually agrees what he saying and they see something in that person instead of just having congress vote count mostly instead of the citizens.

And its not really fair that a person wins just because of his or hers own group of electors gets him to win it should just be based on popularity because its fair as i said before for example what if their was some person running for president and he was not really good to run the United States and yeah some people voted for him but he wasnt as popular but he won the election because of his group itb wouldnt really be fair because  the people perferd the other guy better in office. Why because ethier people liked what he had for the states n what he would offer to the people and actually help us live good and thats what is important for the state its all about the people wants because thats how we will live right.

Also the person running for office might not have any electorial votes because theie campaigning wasnt heavy in a certain part of the state so they would oviously vote for the other person because they really havent seen what that person has to offer to them and he will have less succes in winning the election.

It can be argued that the Electoral College method of selecting the president may turn off potential voters for a canidate witch means that they can relie on  their state as much so they really wouldnt pay attention to the campaign than they would have if the president were picked by a popular vote but of course no voters vote swings a national election.

And thats why I favor in popularity votes because its more fair for the canidates and its a better system in electing a president.
