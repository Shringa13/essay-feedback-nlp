I disagree, because some times there is nothing there that interest. Many schools dont have a program that people like. So if they force some one to do something that they dont like it could make them frustrated. There is something good to it. It can make them try new stuff.

It can get them interested new jobs they can try. A new future they can try to achieve. it could also make them a more interesting person. More possible people talk to about the topic. But they could despise the topic.

Than forcing them in to it could make the hate it more. There could be some personal stuff that do's not let them join a club. some personal trauma that makes them less likely to join a club. it could also be that they just dont want to do it. Being part of a sports team is also very physically demanding.

There is always chance they could not make it on the team. Plus there is always a chance of being kicked out of the club or team. Plus if you try a sport out and figure out that you dont like it you can always quit. There is always a chance that the club could not even help you in the real world. There could be no real world implication.

In conclusion some times people could like try new things out. People could also no like change in their schedule. Forcing stuff on people isnt the best option. There is always a chance they might like the club. You might make some new friends.
