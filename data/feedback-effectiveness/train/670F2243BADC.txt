dear state senator

Over the years many people have complained that voting for a president of the united states is unfair. That they fell that someting should be done to change the voting system. In the articals given to me i have read some resons to keep it and to abolish it. In source one the electoral college is a process, not a place. the founding fathers astablished it in the constitution as a compromise between elections. For the president by a vote in congress and election of the president by a popular vote of qualified citizens.

The electoral college consists of 538 electors but if a majority is 270 electoral votes. Under the 23rd amendment of the constitution the district of columbia is allocated 3 electors and treated like a state for pourposes of the electoral college. You are choosing an electors when you vote for president because when you vote for a canidate u a really voting for your candidate's electors. There are some little things that need to be done to fix it a little like fir example the part thats stats that smaller states have barly no power and that most presedents dont even wory about then becuse they don't make muche of a difrance. Each party selects a state of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee (and that trust is rarly betrayed). The other problen that is with this system is that the winer takes all when the are may poeple that vote for ether for the republican or democratic if the oponunt has more votes they won all the electors and the oponunt does not get any votes from that state so its like you didin't even vote. If it was up to me to keep the electoral callege system i would say yes but they just have to make some few changes.
