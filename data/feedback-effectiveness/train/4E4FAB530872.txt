I agree with policy 1 because student should get to bring their cell phones to school. Some reasons why students should be allowed to bring them to school are, students might need to have them for family emergencies, students might need them for contacting there parents to transport them home from after school activities, students can use the calculator on there phones for math, students can take pictures with there friends, students might need to use the internet, and students can text other students to see what's up. All of these reasons can help students have a better and much easier life personally and educationally. If students weren't allowed to bring them at all there lives would be so much harder. Students could also listen to music with there cell phones. Music helps relieve stress and calm peoples nerves. It also helps people relax. The only thing bad is students could bring them to class and secretly text or some other thing and it could possibly bring there grades down. But teachers get to bring there cell phones to school and use them anytime they want so why shouldn't students? Students should have the same rights as teachers or any adults. The constitution says that all people are created equal. That should give students the right to bring cell phones to school. Well that's all I got to say so thank you for your time on reading this letter. Please put these thoughts into consideration.
