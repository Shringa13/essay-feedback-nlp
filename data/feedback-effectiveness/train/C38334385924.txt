Their are some schools that offer to attend online classes or video conferencing what if they don't have a computer at home for to be able to use it for the online class. Some parents will not agree I think because they will be working and they don't know with who they can leave their kids with. Video Conferencing could work for students instead of online classes because that way the person that will come to teach you can explain more better from the assignments that your suppose to do. Some students just prefer someone to teach them for they can help with what they are doing. Students will benefit from being abkle to attend classes from home will some students they would rather take classes home then school because in school they think it's more harder for them for the reason of being with alot of stusdents. They like to work alone quite and with someone who can have patients and work slowly and have time. Same thing with there schedule when you have classes at home you can choose the time and day that you want to do the class.
