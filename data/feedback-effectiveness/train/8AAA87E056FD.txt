Have you ever needed advice from someone? If so, you probably talked to multiple people before you went on with what you were going to do. Some of the many reasons people do this include getting different perspectives, see the other side of an issue, and get more information on the subject.

The biggest reason someone may ask another person for advice is because there are different perspectives that can go with a subject. You can talk to people you may not see eye to eye with and get insight on their differing opinion. This leads to good discussions with people on the topic you're trying to learn about through the information you're given.

With advice, you want to know the other side of something and if what you're going to do is right or wrong. You can develop potential arguments to strengthen your side and you can know everyone's views to go along with your subject. Based on what you learn from everyone, you could get the full circle of information on what you'd like to learn about.

Lastly, you get more advice as well from asking others for advice. You can learn from other's experience, and in the end learn from your own. You'll know what went wrong in what the person did and why you're getting that advice. Other people will also think one thing is more important than the other. You'll have an overall bigger decision to make in the end with who's advice you're going to follow and how you're going to do it.

People ask other people for advice because they can get different perspectives, see the other side of something, and have the most information they could get. Everyone needs advice at some point in time and with the information they get from others, they can make the best decisions possible.
