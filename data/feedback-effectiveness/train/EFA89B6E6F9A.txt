The electorian collage is a very popular thing amonst states and well some states have a just one law for it others are a lot more strict on there laws one of the ways they can win is by a winner take all vote but the other way is by a more popular vote where the people can vote and then the winners of the voting will vote agenst eachother and thoes two states are nebraska and maine

So what is the electorial collage you might ask well what happends is voters vote not for the president but for a state of electors who in turn elect the president if you lived in texas and voted for john kerry you vote for a state of 34 democratic electors pledged to kerry. on the off chance that thoes electors won the statewide electon they would get 34 electoral votes and kerry would get 34 electoral votes.
