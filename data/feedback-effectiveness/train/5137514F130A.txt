I think that when picking the president that the people of the united states should be the ones to pick instead the electoral college makes the choices of who we get for president. When you vote along with everyong else i think that the majority of the votes should get that presedent instead of everyone voteing and then it getting sent to the electoral college and them getting to pick who they want wich i dont think is right i think that the people should pick who they want by the votes. The one with the most popular vote should win. When you vote for a presidential candidate you are actually voting for slate of electors. The electoral college consist of 538 electors and a majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the president. If you where running for president and you didnt have as many votes from the people as the ofter guy you can still win the election cause of the electoral college is the one that makes the decision to who we have as the president.

each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee. It is entirely possible that the winner of the electoral vote will not wing the national popular vote. This is a very rare thing to happen it has only ever happen twice it happen in 2000 and 1888. People think that they should abolish the electoral college because they think it is not right that they get to vote for who actually becomes president they think it should be the citizens right to pick who we want as president rather than letting the electoral college vote for us for president. In columbia they are allocated 3 electors and treated like a state for purposes of the electoral college. In conclusion i think that it is not right that the electoral college gets to pick are president for us but i think that we should be able to pick are president by popular vote instead of haveing that electoral college.
