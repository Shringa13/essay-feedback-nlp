Dear, TEACHER_NAME

I think that student have a b average. I believe that they should have a C or B average to play sports. I say so because if the student goes out for a team with one point off from a B average and the have a C average then they might be hurt. With a B average they are doing good but no disrespect a C average isn't failing so why not make it that as well.

Now if the kid had a D average they should be taken off the team they are on so they can pull it up and not get low grades again. Most kid think that if they had again in the middle of school the have an excuse to not do their home work but that their fault. With a C average kids can work hard so they don't drop down to a D.

Another reason that you should make it a C average is so the team at the school wont get dropped from any events. With most of the kid with C' s the school may not have any events for kids to try out for. With that the coach might not have time to try out the kids for the team. some coaches might not even let the kid try out. So i ask you in the nicest way i can please let the kids play sports and get involved in other actives with a C average.

sincerely, STUDENT_NAME
