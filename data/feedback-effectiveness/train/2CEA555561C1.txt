Dear state senator i am writing to you because i would like to try a different way to select the president by using the popular. most states have a "winner-take-all" that awards all electors to the winning presidential candidate. the electoral college is just a process where election of the president by vote in congress and election of the president by a popular vote of qualified citizens. the electoral college process consists of the selction of the electors the meetin of the electors where tey vote for president and vice president and the counting of the electoral votes by congress.

when using the electoral college system to vote you voters vote not for president,but for a slate of electors who in turn elect the president. the single best argument against the electoral college is what we might call the disaster factor, the american people should consider themselves lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century ; the system allows for much worse. at the most basic level the electoral college is unfair to voters. Because of the winner-take-all system in each state. the electoral college is unfair,outdated, and irrational. the most basic arguments in favor of it are mostly assertions without much basis in reality. and the arguments agianst direct elections are spurious at best. its hard to say this but bob dole was right :abolish the electoral college!

The electoral college is widely regarded as an anachronism,
