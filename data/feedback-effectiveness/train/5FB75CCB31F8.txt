When it comes to having a computer program to help the teachers know what is going on with the class it should be used. If the program can tell how every kid is doing during class they should be using it. This technology can help with keeping the kids concentrated and help them learn better. If they can tell how the kids feel about a certain subject it can help teachers know that they should stop teaching it and teach another or that they like that subject. IT could also tell the teacher if the kid is struggling with the homework it can tell the teacher to help the kid out. Especially for the little kids who are to scared to ask questions or even middle or high schooler.

Another thing the Facial Action Coding System could really help with an issue like suicide. If these programs are telling us that there sad we can ask them if there's anything wrong and if they need to talk to anyone. These outputs of how they feel can help the world especially if it can help catch suicides from happening. These programs could also help teach how a certain test or classes make them feel.

My only problems is time. If the programs take an hour or more plus time you can't really act on the problem imediatly. Also the way that people feel changes so fast that if you do ask how they feel they could be just fine by then. Also another problem i could see is can it take one face or a whole class room of faces. If it can take a whole classroom and spit out how each individual felt at that exact moment then we should us them in classes.

If they can not do these things they should be worked on till they can do those two things. These facial action coding system should be improved so that it can fo those two things and be put in all schools as soon as possible. This device can change teaching for good and also save lives in the process.
