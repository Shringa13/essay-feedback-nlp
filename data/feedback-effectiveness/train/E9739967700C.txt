I prefer policy 1 because i think we should be able to use are cell phones at lunch and other free times and because sometimes it gets boring at lunch and i just feel like texting as long as its turned off in class i think we should have them and i think that its crazy because were almost grown and we still have to put phones in the lockers and another reason why i think we should have phones is because what if the school or something happen to the school i wont be able to keep in touch with her and i think some boys try to get a girl number at lunch time so we should have are phones instead of waiting until the afternoon so i can write it down on a slip of paper and i think we should because and because what if we are sick or don't feel good and the teacher wont let us go to the nurse then i should be able to text my mother and tell her that im sick can you come pick me up or bring me some medicine and having a phone in the lunch is phone because when you just feel like you don't wont to be bothered then you can plug in some earphones to your phone listen to music and eat so yes TEACHER_NAME

i think we should be able to have phones during lunch and any free time we get.
