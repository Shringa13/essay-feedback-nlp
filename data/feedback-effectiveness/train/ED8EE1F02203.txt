A electors  college is a process , not a place. The electoral college was established it is the constitution as a conpromise betweet election of the presendent by a vote in congress and electection of the presendent by a popular vote of qualified citizens. The election college it like what person you want to br the presendent , maybe you dont vote for that person maybe someone will vote for them. youcan votefor anyboby only if you think that person is good for the comminuty.

I think the vic presedent is like to help out with work or it the presendent retired maybe the vic presendent will take out now the vic presendent will be the new presendent. In the story it say that each member that vote in the house of representative plus two fie you senators. You help choose your state electors when you vote for presendent because when you vote for your condidute you are actully voting for your condidate's electors. the certificate of ascertainment also declares the winning presendent candidate in your statae and shows which electors will represent you r state at the meeting.

In the story they ask you what is wrong with the electors college. I think the problem is that one the off-change that those electors be anyone not holding public office. The single best argument agaisnst the electorsal college is what they might call the disaster factor. they the people in american should consider themselves lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century; the system allows for much worse. is the most worrying  the prospect of s tie in the electoral vote. In that case, the election would be thrwn to the house of representatives, where state delegation vote on the presendent. And the thing is that the senate would choose the vice-presendent. because each state cast only one vote, the single representative from wyoming, representing 5000,000 votes would have sa much say as the 55 representative from carofornia, who represent 35 million votes.
