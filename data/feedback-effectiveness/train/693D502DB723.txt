Dear Principal,

Have you ever, when you were a teen, owed lunch money, and you need to call a parent to drop you off money? This example leads me to believe that policy one is the better choice because teens, and children should be allowed to have their cell phones out at free times such as study hall, lunch and after school hours.

What if, the school policy was that you couldn't have cell phones out at all! How would you be able to eat lunch if you owed money and you couldn't eat because of it?

Also what if you had an emergency and you needed to call your parent immediately and you were not allowed to have a cell phone out at all (policy two )! I believe that students should be allowed to have their cell phones with them as long as they are off in their bag or pocket.

But, this does NOT mean that they should have it out texting, only if an emergency approaches and it is strictly needed. This is why policy one is the superior choice for the school.

Sincerely,
