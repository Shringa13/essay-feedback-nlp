Dear senator,

I was meaning to ask you can you please leave the electoral college. In way many people were grateful for this kind art education in many ways people use this place for so long to know how many scarefices that many people choose this area than no other. There got to be a diffrent reason to come in mind for can stop this idea from elimanating this fine place to construct for all years of hard work. For so long many people still would like to choose this college as great example for their success. This my letter to you senator. But if you refuse this than i don't know what i would do,but  what I do know is you choose what it came from your mind I can not stop you from picking the good or bad  choices but I can help you pick the right choice. As well making a election area that only happens in four years is not really worth anything many would disagree for this nonsense build and just forget what just came in mind and pick the right choice.
