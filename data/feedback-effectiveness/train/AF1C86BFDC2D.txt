I think that we should change the voting system from the Electoral college to the most popular vote. Let me tell you why I think we should.

The first reason is that it is unfair to voters and presidential nominees. If the voters can not get there votes in to the nominee that they want then how do the votes go to the right elector. For example,the winner take all system,presidential nominees go to the states that they know they have a chance of getting there votes from. A few states never saw a campaign ad such as Rhode island and south Carolina,voters from 25 of the largest media markets didn't get to see a single campaign ad.

The second reason is that most voters only vote if they they like him or her on the way he or she dresses,talks,looks like,race,etc. Real voters now what they are doing and know who is really better for the country on his or hers facts and statistics. Some people just don't know who they should really vote for but that's what makes the country bad off. For example,people could vote for a president who says to lower minimum wage so so the higher paid people get paid more but he or she don't tell you about cutting down the minimum wage to $5.00 and then the people who voted for the good nominee and get paid minimum wage are now getting paid less but really the other nominee is the good one.

The third reason is that even Richard Nixon,Jimmy carter,Bob Dole,the U.S. Chamber of commerce,and the AFL-CIO all agreed on abolishing the electoral system. Almost every one has agreed on abolishing the electoral system. But there needs to be more people with higher grounds and words to abolish the system.

In conclusion the electoral college has no really good side to it. Its unfair,outdated and irrational. Almost everyone says to get rid of it. If you want it gone your gonna have talk to someone of high authority.
