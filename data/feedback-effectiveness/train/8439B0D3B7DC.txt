techonology called the ficial Action coding System enavles computer to identify human emotions is really good thing. we would like to know If they are lying about their emotional. Dr. Huang is really smart but I think he is right.

First,computer to identify human emotions is really good thing because we would know If they are lying to us or no. Acoording the text " can we actually "calculate"emotions like math homework",I think they got the right point because our emotional is like calculate. They have to calculate are we really sad or happy. Another example from the text" The Mona lisa demonstration is really intended to bring a smile to your face, while it shows just how much this computer can do". I Hope our school should do like that so people we could help other people whenever we are sad.

Second,these day a lot of people they are lying to another people to much. Honestly, I used to cheat on my girlfriend too back in the day but the good part is that we don't know facial action yet. If we both know that time I bet she will say" let do this because I want If you are cheating on me". Still right now she don't know that I cheat on her but we are already broke tho. I saw on social media a lot Boyfriend and girlfriend did that. When they know they both got cheating,both of them feel wierd. People is really good at hide thing I hope we are did Facial Action so we could know how is lying or nah.

Finally,I think Dr huang is really smart doing those kind of thing." The software is the latest innovation from prof,Thomas Huang if the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science at the University OF

lllinois."Some day I want be like him,He is my idol from now. Also If someone ask me who would I want to meet right now,I would say" I want to meet with Dr. Huang".

Conclusion,every year different technology is coming out,I can't Imagine what is going be like in 20 year later. What kind of technology would be going out.
