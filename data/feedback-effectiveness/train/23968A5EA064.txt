It would be awsome to identify human emotions,and knowing what students feel in class can be really useful.

I think the new technology that reads emotional expressions of people can be useful in schools. The teachers will be able to know when the students are bored, in the article it said "A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored." it let's the teacher know by the students emotions that the lesson is boring or the lesson is not understandable for them. The new technology can help teachers make their plan lessons more fun and understandable and if the schools of all around the world uses the new technology it would be lot easier for the teachers to make the students be more focus on school and the lesson, but not only the technology can help schools it can also help people with their business, but that's not the point the point is that school's should start using the new the technology to help students stay in school and helped them to stay focus. But not only it helps during class time it can also help outside of school like if the student's play sports the coches can know when the student is sad, tired, happy,or angry. So I think having the new technology in school can be really helpful and useful for everyone but most likely the teacher's.
