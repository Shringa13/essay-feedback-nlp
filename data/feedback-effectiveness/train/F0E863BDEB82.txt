In this essay, I will be discussing the non-existence of ancient Martians that theorists claim to be real because of a land formation that lots of people so passionately call "the Face". First and formost, Martians have been wafting around the population; because of the amount of time it has been around and all of the conspiracy, this has lead many conspirarists to go to extremes to prove that anything that anyone can believe in is real. For instance, now people are starting to prove that aliens are real because of a big face-shaped mountain on Mars. This is, of course, completely absurd to say the very least, due to the lack of evidence they have in corrispondence to the large amount of evidence that we at NASA already have. Really though-- all they have are sci-fi movies, fiction novels, and talk-shows-- when we have already proven that it is obviously just an odd formation (that with shadows, angles, and imagination) just looks like a face. After the Mars Global Surveyor flew by Cydonia one day in April, it was completely proven to be just your average land formation. Afterwards, skeptics still were not satisfied, even with the incontroversial evidence that all it was was a rock formation. So, we flew by AGAIN, just to prove that that was all it was. So, that was the complete and utter proof that this so-called "Face" was just a big rock in the end.
