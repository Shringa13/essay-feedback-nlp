Dear Mr. Principal

The idea of making school policy that you have to have at least a grade average of a B is a good idea, but you would have more of your star players ineligible to play because of grades. Now if our school was known for its brains and not sports, then yes i would encourage this but it's not. We are known for our sports winning state championships in all of the sports we offer. Changing the eligibility level to having at least a B or better, could possible shoot down every thing our school is known for and why people want to come to it and those who don't fear us in an athletic category. I believe though if you must make this a rule, then you have to get the ones who aren't as smart tutors or someone to help them get the grades to play their sport. For other activities the I can see where having an eligibility grade of at least a B could be a good thing like ski club, that's something that you can do by yourself bu the school provid

In conclusion I believe that it could be a good idea if our school was known for its grades but because it's just the opposite, we need to keep the eligibility level at a C average to maintain our reputation to those outside of school and those who may be thinking of coming to our school.

Sincerely,
