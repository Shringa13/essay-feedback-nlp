Dear senator you should chaange the voting rules from Electoral College to popular vote because the Electoral College is to confusing. Popular vote is a more efficent way to vote for the presedent.

For example in the article Does the Electoral College Work it says that the Electoral College votes by people who are profetionals and popular vote is by the people of the United States of America. This quote explains how the popular vote is better because it is decided by the people not the government.

AnotherÂ  reason why you should change the voting rules is that the Electoral College doesnt even work. In the article it explains how''under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the presedent ,but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president.''This quote explains that the electoral college has nothing to do with the people the vote is not decided by the people why have any people to begin with.

I just think overall you should consider the tip and change the voting rules.

Another reason why the electoral college has to be gone is it is un orginized. In the text ''The indefensible electoral college why even the best-laid defense of the systeme are wrong.''the quote explains that even though both systems of voting work,popular vote is the more dominant rule.

In conclution you need to change the system for the people and overall just make voting a lot easier.
