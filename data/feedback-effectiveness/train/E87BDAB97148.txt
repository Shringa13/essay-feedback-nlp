Yes they should change to a election by popular vote. They should change to this because then they will know the actual amount of votes. And because they can see how many people want that person to become president instead of the electors because what if one of the electors changes their mind and goes for another person. Then that person can't revote and they are stuck voting for the person they do not want. And if it is changed it may cause problems politically.

The reason why people would most likely not want to change it because they might like voting for an elector and because they might think it is much easier and wont take as long to choose the president. Also the Louisiana legislature might replace the electors with new electors who would vote for John F. Kennedy. And that would be unfair because the popular vote would not really be for John F. Kennedy. Also there could be a tie in the electoral vote instead of a winner sometimes. Then the House of Representatives would have to vote if that did happen.

The electoral college is proven to be unfair to voters because of the winner takes all system. And so the dont spend time in the states because they know they have no chance in winning. And the state might pick a elector that they do not like by accident and mess up their vote. And the electors can only be people not holding public office. They might also choose a certain president because of his or her race.

And the thing is that the people do not choose the president the electors elect the president. Sometimes but it hardly ever happens, the elector chosen would change their vote to the other president. It depends on the state on who would most likely become president because the more people the bigger the vote will be. Also the electoral college method might turn of certain voters. And sometimes no candidate wins the majority vote and this causes pressure and makes it complicated to elect the president.
