Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I am aware that you are aware that some kids from our school are debating wether to do community service or not. I would highly encourage you to help these boys see the benefit in doing this. I know for a fact that I am doing this to better our community and our school. I don't recommend that you should require kids to do this I'm just saying that you should get kids who want to help, come and help.

I believe that kids in 7th to 12th grade should learn how to do service. When people hear the words Community Service I believe that they think of being in trouble (some times it is getting in trouble). I don't how to put this TEACHER_NAME but l think that by doing a good service to the community will be good to our school, especially friends, and families that help serve in the community. I believe that the people who work in the police department and as the fire squad should have a day off once every two months so that kids that are my age can help out too. I would advise you to help kids get in the act in helping, there's kids out there that know how to help but they just refuse to help.

lf you know what I'm saying then you should help me get friends to do this with me and hopefully some of the people in my ward.

Thanks for your time and have a great day!

Sincerely your fellow student at this school
