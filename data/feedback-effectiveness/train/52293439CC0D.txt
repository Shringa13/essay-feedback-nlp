The Author supports the idea of studying venus. In paragraph 2, "the author says that numerous factors conmtribute to Veunus reputation as a challenging planet for humans to study on". Another reason why from the author that humans should study venus and wothy pursuit. In paragraph 3, sentence 4 "it says that the conditions are far moire extreme than anything humans can study on encounter". My reason why i think humans should study venus and worthy pursuit despite the danger is because in paragraph 1, sentence 1 its that in sted of calling it venus they call is Evening star and it is one of the brightest of the light in the night sky. Now in the last sentence its say that it proved a very challenging place to examine more closely. But in my own words i think it is a good idea for humans shoukld study venus because it gives you fun facts about it , How i know that is because in paragraph 8, the last sentcene its talking about you get to travle on earth and you it to see whats beyond you should not be limited by dnager or anything else. And another evidence you get to learn about new things in life and it can be a challenge for you in life also. My conclusion to this hole essay is if you can explorie anything in life then you can take a risk and in doing a challenge on exploring venus or another name for it Evening star. Not just because it can give you a fun fact it can give you a differnet experion on other people and you can show other people that there can be a differnce in everythiung that you can do.
