Well i would choose , allow students to bring phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times , as long as the phones are turned off during class time . ''

A reason why is because for just in case of an emergency , you just call your parents and ask them to help you with the situation your in .

A second reason is because you might feel sick and would want to call your parents to go home .

Then my third reason would be , for when your in lunch and you just want to chat with your friend and tell them how was school and what their going to do after school .

Also , you might want to turn off your phone cause might not want to be in class and your friend or parents call you and interrupts your teacher or learning .

So this is why i pick
