Dear principal,

I think you should let us students to bring our cell phones to school because we are in a growing society and we all need to communicate.

to begin with i consider all students must have a cell phone in order to text their class mate to ask about the home work from last night. or just to have a briefly talk about the test in class that they are giving or just to let the students have more freedom. also texting is being more widely used than any other devise in earth like face book or twitter they are both being used to talk on the phones know every body has a phone i am right yes because technology has been growing rapidly and faster then ever know on days you don't see that device what was it called oh yea the beeper because it took so much time to call the one typing it in and for her to send the message to the other person beeper that has become obsolete.

also phones have been one the worlds greatest inventions. in fact the on who created the first phone was Alexander gram bell and know look at the phones they even have GPS. they can take you to their destination with out problem is like the sexton that used triangulation to find your position in earth. but know they use seven GPS to know where you are and were are you going now they are more accurate they take anywhere any time any place. phones have develop allot know there even a hand free devise that you use that is not even a cord is just dangling from your ear and it its totally cool to have one i have one.

so please principal with your rat honor please allowed phones for us to call each other. also hanks for taking your time and reading this thank you allot i hope you take my opinion in consideration
