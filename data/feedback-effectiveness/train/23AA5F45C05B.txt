Taking participation in the Seagoing Cowboys program is more of a different world then an adventure! This program helps you think of the people in need and how much you have helped them. Participating in this fun program is a great idea! Just imagine... riding on a boat, mist spraying, cooling you off after a long day herding animals. You have the benefit to see and tour many places that you have never seen before! Trust me. We all need to participate in the Seagoing Cowboys program!

The Seagoing Cowboys program is a great oppertunity to help those in need to recover their food supplies. Doing this can help you be more aware of the people in need and help you know that you have been great help to them. This program hires men to take care of the horses, cows, and mules that were shipped over seas. This can make you come closer to the animals and let them know that you care very much for them!

Not only can you help, but this job does inquire some fun! You have the benifit to see and tour special landmarks and places that you have never seen before! It is quite an adventure! It is an unbelievable oppertunity to see all kinds of sites (especially on the job!).

On board, you can also find time to have fun! When you are on return trips after the animals are unloaded, you can play many games such as baseball, volleyball, and table-tennis in the empty holds where the animals stay. Fencing, reading, whittling, fun games, and boxing make some boat trips exciting!

Overall, taking part in the seagoing Cowboys program is an excilent oppertunity! It is more of a new world rather then just an site-seeing adventure! Taking part in this activity would make you feel better about helping not just your community, but citizens beyond your community, too! Helping those who need your support is quite the heroic thing to do!
