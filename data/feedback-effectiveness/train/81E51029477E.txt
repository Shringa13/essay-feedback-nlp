Dear,

Sate Senator ,

We need to keep the Electoral College . It clearly states in paragraph 1 why we need to keep the Electoral College there are so many reason why but only one can bring it to staying in the system."Electoale College is a process, not a place. The founding fathers established it in the constitution as a comprise between election of the President by vote in Congress and elction of the President by a polular vite of quarified citizens". What i am clearly trying to state is the the Elecotoral College needs to stay in the system.

Many people will say different but only in my opinion we need ot keep the Elcectral College, it is part of the Constitution of the United Sates of America if it clearly staes stuff about the Electoal College in the Consistitution then that means you need to keep it in the sistem to help with all the dier need that the world has to offer for the Electoral College just dont get rid of it for no reason you need to have a really great suggestion to remove it out of the system.

All i am trying to say is that in my opinion if you care at all, the we need to keep the Electoral College alive dont just kick it out the system if it sates its name in the Constitution then it need to stay where its at dont delte it from the program just becauss of some stupid process you need a darn good reason to remove it not just because you feel like it thats not good enough you need to show emotion about how the Electoral College is in the Constisution

Please look at my reason in why to keep it in the sytem thank you so greatly much. Just take me up on my opinion i am usally right in cases like this i show great emotion in stuff like this all you need to do is look at the facts and you will see why i want the it to stay moving and not to be kicked out.
