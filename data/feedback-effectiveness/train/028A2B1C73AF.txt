Is there really a new kind of life on mars. No! We are the only life in this universe. Plus if people lived on mars, how could they build such a huge amount of rock into a face so perfectly.

What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa--landforms. Also back then they did not have that great of cameras but now they do. With the new cameras, we could acually see that it was just a landform with cracks in it. The only reason people think it is a sign, is because of the shadows. It makes up its eyes, nose, and mouth. What, do you think they could make that with their bare hands?

I don't think that there is people on mars, if there was , we would have probably found them all ready. I beleive that the [face] is not really a face. If you you beleive that there is, than thats fine but the real truth is that its not a face.
