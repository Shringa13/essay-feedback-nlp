Students should participate in at least one extracurricular activity because they could make life long friends that have the same interest. For an example, if you join a club or sport and know nothing about it, you could ask someone in that club or sport to explain and help you understand more about it. After that, you just might have a new friend.

Students could join a extracurricular activity because they need a hobby. Students who don't have any activities to do after-school should sign up for a sport or club because they could become really interested in it and keep doing that activity throughout the school year. Students should join extracurricular activities because they could be fun and it could be a new experience.

Students could join a extracurricular activity to make new friends. If you have a small friend group and want to expand, joining a club and/or sport would be a good option because there's always teamwork involved. Students could make friends just by having the same interest in a activity, subject, hobby, etc.

In conclusion I think joining a extracurricular activity is a good idea for students because they could make new friends and find a new hobby they like.
