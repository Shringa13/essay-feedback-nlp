Fellow citzens i am here to inform about the advantages of limiting car usage. limiting car usage has made people feel safer walking and planners are noe taking the concept to the suburbs. expert says its a huge impediment to current efforts to drastically reduce greenhouse gases.

In this new approach to limit car usuage stores are placed a walk away on a main street,rather than in malls along some distant highway. even in the united states the enviromental protection agency is promoting "car reduced" communities and legislators are starting to act, if cautiously.

for example congestion went down in france after five days not being to drive and of intensifiying smog.70 percent of vaubans families do not own cars,and 57 percent  sold a car to move here. most people are happier with the the car usage limit due to that fact that they have too be tense anymore. and the wandering children drown out the occasional distant motor.

Vauban,home to 5,500 people wihtin a rectangular square mile , is the most advanced experiment in low-car sudan surburban. many experts expect public transport serving suburbs to play a much larger role in a six year federal transportation bill to be approved this year.

New suburbs may look more vauban-like,not only in developed countries but also in developing world,vauban,germany residents of this upscale community are suburban pioneers,going where few soccer moms or commuting excutives have ever gone before: they have given up their cars .

Vauban,completed in 2006,is anexample of a growing trend in europe,the united states and else where to seperate surburban life from auto use,as a component of a movement called "smart planning".
