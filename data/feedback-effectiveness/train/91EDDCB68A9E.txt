The Electoral collage is a process , not a place. The founding fathers established it in the constitution as comprimise between election of the president by a popular vote of qualified citizens. The thing is the president shouldnt be picked on his personality or his or hers past, they should be judged by the changes they can make and how they can make it better for the people on the out side world. they shouldnt be voted by the fancy no good stuck ups in the office 24/7 bc half the time they dont know good, i mean look at the president we have now.

The process consists of the section of the electors, which they vote president or vice president. under the Electoral collage system voters vote not for president but for a state of elections. They shouldnt have to vote like that , why have the office men and women vote president? When u could have the citizens of state do it. The office men and women dont know what the citizens want or need. There just there to get money and sit on there butts 24/7 and do nothing but make poor decisions as a reference to our president.

The most worrying is the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote. Then in that case the election would be thrown to The House of Representatives , where state delegations vote on the president. There shouldnt be a tie and having to be thrown in to The House of Represntatives. The president shouldnt be selected by valets and posters. they should be picked based apone what there capable of and how they can change the owrld and make it a better and safer place. The president we have now didnt come with its benifites.

At all basic levels the Electoral collage is unfair to voters. Because of the winner-takes-all system in each states, candidates dont spend time in each state they know they have no changes of winning or losing , so they focus only on the tight races.
