I feel like it would be a great idea to have Driverless Cars. Why? It'll prevent people from crashing into others and risking their lives and also it'll decrease chances of trafic on express ways. And marketing would sky rocket. Many people would love to travel places but they'll get lazy to drive, but if they have a car that can drive itself then it would make it better on the humans life aswell.

Many people also agree on how bad it is. Honestly it does have some flaws and miss happs. One of them are getting sent to a different location. Just like G.P.S., you type in your address and sometimes it sends you somewhere you didn't want to go. A Driverless Car is like a driving G.P.S., it could also have a malfunctioning problem it could put your life at risk and others.

At the end of the day technology will have a lot of malfunctioning problems and a Driverless Car will be one of them. So be smart and purchase one at your own risk.
