It's common that some students don't want to stay after school, other students could have other events to attend to, and that can get in the way of students education.

If schools are already making it stressful for students think about how it might impact on their mental health and grades, fewer students might not have interest about the programs that the schools are suggesting, this could also get in the way of spending time with your family, and that could increase major mental health issues to the students in the future.

It's normal if students don't like staying after school, but if schools are forcing students to do something that they don't want to do, that could develop a students safety and they might not want to go to school anymore.

Maybe staying after school could help increase students self-confidence, make new friends, or increase their mental health.

It's always best to give students options, and letting them enjoy what they do best at, but it's not right to force them into doing what they don't want to do; yes I agree that after school activities should be in school, and open to all students.

Don't force students into something they don't feel comfortable with, but recommend it to them so they can think about it.

Everyone should get the chance to stay after school just once, and if they don't like it they don't have to continue staying in an after school program.
