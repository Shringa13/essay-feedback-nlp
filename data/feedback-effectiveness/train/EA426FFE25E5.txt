With the face on mars no one belived that it was actually a face they thought that it was and ancient monument on mars and when NASA first saw the face on mars they thought that it was the landging place of the viking 1's sister ship the viking 2. Then when they put that photo out of the face on mars people were using it in haunted grocery stores checkout lines, radio talk shows, magazines, books, and hollywood films.

Then even some scientists belived that they face was an alien artifact so when people did not belive them they went and took more picture of the face but it was mars cloudy day and people still did not belive them. So NASA went back for another one but to get a better picture they had to get closer to the face and role the ship twenty five degrees to the center they also had to go over the face very often because it was hard to get the picture.

The spaceship would look over mars like a faxing machine but lucky for them going around the face very often it got to a point to were their was no clouds and they were able to get a good shot of the face. So NASA was able to get a better picture of the face so that people would belive them that it was a face in the surface on mars.

The face was not accutally formed from the viking 2 but from a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same hight as the Face on the moon. So the face on mars was alo just a huge rock formation and the eyes nose and mouth was just an illussion formed from a shadow. Also about the alien articact their was not one they thought that their was a hidden alien artifact and hidden alien marking hidden by the haze.
