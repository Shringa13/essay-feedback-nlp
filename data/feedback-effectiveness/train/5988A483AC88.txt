Dear principal

You are about to make a deciding between whether to make your student.

Perform community service . to whatever decision you make you will always have your good and bad reaction. So know whatever you pick people going have a opinion. Now i am going give to difference reason on both sides.

Now i don't think you make kids do community services for a number of things.

NUMBER ONE: You don't how the family life is out side of school they might be deliver with some problems and they don't have time.

NUMBER TWO: Kids should have the right to do community services. If they want to do it that's there thing . that what they want to we should force them i know you have the right be they have there own right.

Now if they want to do community service then ha who stopping them.

But if you do force them they probably learn some thing and when some try new thing they have fun and things like that.

Well i hope i help made your decision bye.

sincerely STUDENT_NAME
