Looking at driverless cars may seem a bit odd. What is a car that you don't even really have to drive? That's not a car! Although, I am claiming to be on both sides of this situation, it may be that I would never purchase this type of car. SInce these cars have the name of driverless cars, people may not take these seriously. It does state in the article that the car does alert the driver of some things. But if you really look into it, what happens if the car glitches and doesn't alert the driver? What then? This problem may cause an accident and prohibit the driver of a bigger chance of harm.

Driverless cars may seem fun, which I have never actually been in one nor seen one, but not having to drive seems pretty relaxing, even though you hold the wheel. It may also has the downs. Let's say that somone is on their way to the hospital rushing for a loved one who is terribly hurt. How does the driverless car react? There's a whole bunch of questions, but the actual question is, is it safe for everyone to handle and drive?

All of my questions or your questions may not be answered just yet, but having one of these may be expensive. For an example, as much as gas is, or parts to your normal car are, or even the inside areas, how much will it cost to fix the sensors or even if the driverless car has gas? These things may be a lot harder to pay for since it's all practically technology. I do not recomend these types of cars to anyone simply for my opinion.
