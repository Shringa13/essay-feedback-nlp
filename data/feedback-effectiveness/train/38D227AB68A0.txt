Dear principal,

I personally do not agree with the choice you are considering.

Sports and other activities are very important to some and most students.

These activities allow them to have a chance to relieve the stress that school has caused them.

If students where told that they wouldn't be able to have the rights in participating, unless they have a B average or higher, this would cause them nothing but more stress than what they already have.

Some students rely on sports to keep them motivated.

With no sports or other activities students grades could lower past a C average.

Also, you must put into consideration that if the majority of students have a grade of C average.

Some may not be able to improve their grades.

They may already be trying as hard as they can.

If so, it would become unfair for those students to not be able to participate in sports.

Having these activities open to all students even if they have a C average or a B average, could also help improve their grades.

Sports and other activities include teamwork, motivation, and consequences.

These 3 things are not only needed to help students achieve in sports but to achieve in school too.

In the classroom, students need to know how to use teamwork and motivation.

This will allow them to use teamwork in groups to help improve ones grade.

And motivation will cause one to achieve their work assignments.

And having these available to them, they will know the consequences of not using them correctly.

These will result in bringing students grades up.

Making you happy with their grades and them happy being able to still participate in sports.

Sincerely,

Your fellow student
