Dear TEACHER_NAME,

As a student of this school, I believe it is very necessary to require community service at our school, although many students will not appreciate this, in the long run they will learn to appreciate what they are given and begin to act less selfish and more selfless. Community service will also give them a sense of accomplishment and more responsibility, this will indeed create a busy lifestyle therefore not giving time to do unnecessary or harmful things to themselves of the student body. This act of community service will allow all students to learn and experience new things and better themselves for their future.

I also believe the school administration should create a presentation showing students that this can be indeed a very fun task! For example, if a students enjoys pets' he/she can volunteer at their local pet adoption area. Maybe their is a student who would love to become involved with children or seniors, they may sign-up to help out at a local church, daycare center, pre-k, or nursing home. There are even ways for kids who would like to be a part of the entertaining world to get involved!

Students can get involved in their community in countless ways weather its piking up trash or reading books to a small child, there are only 3 steps to community service... 1)Find out what you would like to do 2) Sign-up for it and 3) Do it and have a blast!

So as you see principle TEACHER_NAME, this will eventually teach all students that helping out is not only productive but fun and will help you towards the future!

You're student,

STUDENT_NAME.
