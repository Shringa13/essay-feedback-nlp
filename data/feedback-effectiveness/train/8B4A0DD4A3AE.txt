I think that luke did the right thing by saying yes to one in a lifetime opportunity. People could have participated in the Seagoing Coyboy program but then again they didn't have to like luke he couldnt say know because it was on in a lifetime opportunity. In Lukes point of view to convise others to come would be it would be a lot of fun you would have a lot of fun you get to be with many people you can talk to people and you can even make new friends. The things that you can probably do there is make new friends talk to people have fun and be thankful you got . You can even bring your familey members with you or you can go a lone it is up to you but come and enjoy your self be happy make new friends and just be your self. You can always try something new rather you like it or you dont like it is is really up to you .You can come and everything but you have to obay the rules and do what you are told and listen. You can also be gratful that you got invitd to come and that luke wanted you to come you should br graeful rather you are or not that you got to go. This is what i think Lukes point of view for convincing people to come.
