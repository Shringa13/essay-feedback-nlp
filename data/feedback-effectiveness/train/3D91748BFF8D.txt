The new hit "the face," has made its way through tv, and articles all across the world. This phenonim is about a small land form on the suface of Mars that takes the look of a face. There a million hypothesis of what it could be, but we have found what it really is. With research we found a logical reson to how we are correct. Some think its from aliens, and some think its just a natural land form but what is it?

Incase you have not heard the "face" has been spotted on Mars, a small landform with some facial features that make it look like one. But a face from an allien, that sounds, and is unlogical. We have done so much reasarch towards this landform. Shadows give it the look of a face, and thats why we can only see it sometimes. In fact mission controllers even said you had to capture it at the correct lighting. But, if it were a real face, you could see it anytime.

In fact we have logical evedience, there are gigantic storms which would have wiped all the alliens out. They would be burried way benith the suface, becuase when Mars has a storm its vicious, and moves dust, dirt, and sediment all over. If there even was alliens they would be covered in hunderds of pounds of dust.

Yet I can see the opposing side saying that since the dust moves around so much how come the bodies couldnt be revealed? This is hundreds of pounds of dust ontop of them. Even though the dust moves so much, there a 1 and a million chnace of it moving above 400 pounds of dust.

In conclusion, this phenomim gives NASA the attention it wants, but its not true. While some might think there was alliens were on Mars, its illogical for their heads to just appear. Even though the opposers think its possible, they are dead and cannot move. Therefore the face is just a landform with shadows that make it look like a face. It it were a face we could see it anytime, but there was lots of research needed to conclude this. Therefore sayin its just a landform.
