Policy one is the right one to do because you might have miss the bus what are you going to do if you don't have a phone. And if you don't get them out thatcher should not be able to take them from you and think that should be a rule. If you forget your work at home what are you going to use to call you parent with? Or you are sick and you need to go home. plus it cant hurt some one or yourself so I think it is dumb that you can not bring a phone to school and that's why I think its dumb that you can not bring a phone to your school if you have them turn down and if do not have them out in class and if you do bring them to school they need to give them back to you at the end of class or at the end of the day .
