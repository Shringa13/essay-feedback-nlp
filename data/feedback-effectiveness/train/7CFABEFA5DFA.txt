I have recently read an article by the name of ¨Driverless Cars Are Coming¨, and asked my opinion.

I believe they could be very dangerous, they´re many sensors and techology to do with the car, who is to say they couldn´t malfunction, or intercept waves a sentence from paragraph 4 indicates my fear,¨For starters, they needed a whole lot of sensors....Prius uses position-estimating sensors on the left rear wheel, rotatin sensor on the roof, a video camera mounted near the rearview mirror, four automotive radar sensors....¨ and much more.

I also believe the driverless cars could put the country in even more debt.

In paragraph six they state that¨Radar was a device on a hilltop that cost two hundred million dollars.¨

The last time I herd the United States was eight trillion dollars in debt, should we really consider adding two hundred million per radar to that eight trillion?

I also would like to go back to the subject of malfuctioning.

If a driverless car malfunction, the company could possibly and most likely be sewed, we would have even more money added to that debt to try to prevent it from happening again and no one really knows spending all that money would even prevent it from malfunctioning again, and lastly we would have some very unhappy customers on our hands.

We could be talking riots, people wanting their money back, shootings, killing.

So many unanswered possibilites could go wrong with this idea and production of ¨driverless cars¨.

In conclusion I believe that ¨driverless cars¨ productivity should be shut down for what we don´t know could become of it in the future wether it be money, mobs of angry customers or people that have been offected by them.
