Dear Senator,

In the past years our country has been run by a "electoral college" voting system. Has always been the soultion to our (america's) equation. Its been in bussines since 2012 now and so far has seen no problems. Our country has a strong base an voting system for our country period .

another great reason electoral college has , is that a big problem ,like "Big States". even if the state has a huge populationÂ  than other states . they equal out the vote of thepopulations so that every one could have an equal chance.

Like how every thing is settled majoritry rule , but in this case "everybodys president". Every one has part in the election during Electoral College , no one is left out like popular voting ways. From "source 3: in defense of the electoral college :five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the president" by richard A. Posner.

Even though" elctoral college may some times be unfair out dated , and irrational."(from "source 2: the indefensible elctoral college: why even the best -laid defenses of the system are wrong"). The way we are voting now has no problems so far , so by far this is the best efficent ,wide variety of choices an accecible to all in the U.S. It has been updated and fitted toward our government.
