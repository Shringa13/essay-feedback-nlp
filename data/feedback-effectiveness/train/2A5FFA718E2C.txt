Dear readers, im here to tell you about the face on Mars. We were traveling up to Mars to get some cool pictures and we noticed that in one of the pictures was a misterious face!

As soon as we saw it everyone directly assummed it was created by aliens. "NASA unveiled the image for all to see. The caption noted "huge rock formation... which rembles a human head. fprmed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth." The authors reasoned it would be a good way to engage the public and attract attention to Mars." (3)

"The "Face on Mars" has since become a pop icon." (5) When I first saw it i had no idea what the face was, i thought maybe it was just me that saw it or something. I would have never guessed that it would become so big to us.

My friend Fred thinks that aliens did it, aliens arent real... are they? i mean ow could such a puniy creater make such a fuse over a interesting face. Aliens are not real!!

When Fred was rantting about how it had to be an alien and nothing else could have made thoose faces i was thinking that he might have gone crazy. I mean it could have been alines but most likly not.
