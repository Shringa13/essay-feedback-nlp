The author thinks, that exploring venus could be a dangerous thing to do because what he says about how other spacecraft landed there and how they didnt live for a few hour that , that is why spacecraft now have not gone to venus in over more than three decades. In paragraph two in the last sentence, it shows how he talked about spacecrafts.

The author also states how the tempeture is in venus in the third paragph, third sentence ,he talks about how hot it is in venus he said it is about over 800 degrees fahrenheit, and it also say¨beyond high pressure and heat,venusian geology and weather present additional impediments like erupting volcanoes,powerful earthquaks,and frequen lighting.....¨

nasa is putting other lives at risk to go study venus, in paragraph five, frst two sentence it tell how nasa might have people go and discover more about venus.

My opinion on all of this that the author was talking about. It feels like a movie like,maybe in the future who knows when, we might have to go to venus because of something that happen in earth. we are going to leave homes and everything we worked on and live a new life in another planet. It kinda reminds me of that movie ¨Wall-e¨ they left earth nasty and a lot of poultion and went to live in a spacecraft in space. I would not want to live like that because what if somthing happened in the spacecraft. Back to what i was talking about, yea it would be cool to live in another planet, but those people that nasa is going to send out ton explore venus, have to explore it really carefully. I find it really interesting how there is a similar planet to earth.
