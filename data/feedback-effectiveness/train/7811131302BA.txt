The aouthor idea might sound or be a little bit carzy. The author however is not wrong, because Venus was once like the earth, still has features like the earth, and it is the nearst option for planetary visit. So let me explain and make the aouthor's idea a little bit less crazy.

Even thought Venus has a thicker atmosphere and is almost 97 percent corbond dioxide blackets according to paragraph 3. It was once earth like. it was proably coverd in large oceans. venus also might of supported various forms of life just like earth like is says in paragraph 4. Maybe one day it will be like earth again.

Venus might have the "hottest surface temperture of any plant in our solar system" (paragraph 3), erupting volcanoes and powerful earthquakes. But it still has features like earth. venus has rocky sediment. It also has mountains and craters like it states in paragraph 4. The might be the reason why they call it earth's "twin" like it says in paragraph 2.

"Venus is the closest planet to eartyh in terms of density and size, and occasionally the closest in distance too". This might be an advantage for NASA. It might be productive but ithas to be safe too. NASA discribe this trip like "blimp-like"(paragraph 5). NASA is already studying and planing for the trip. It they trip might be short comparec to other planets but NASA want to make it as safe as possible.

In conculsion, the authors idea might sound a bit bazzar, but it is not a bad idea. Since the planet a while ago was like earth, still looks like earth, and it is the closest to earth. So maybe in a couple of years NASA might finale make a plantery vist.
