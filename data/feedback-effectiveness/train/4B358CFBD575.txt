Venus is an interesting planet for various reasons.

Scientists believe that Venus is alike to earth. It has about the same density and size compared to earth. In the article it states in paragraph 4 that "Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported varius forms of life, just like Earth." This quote helps state that it is a interesting planet and alike Earth they want to study and learn about it knowing the conditons.

Another example of how Venus is an interesting planet is because of the atmosphere and the ground conditions it has. Astronomers believe humans could survive there, however it wouldn't be easy with the conditions it has. A beam of light can barely pass throught the atmosphere; this causes the standard cameras to be ineffective.

In conclusion, Venus is a very interesting planet and despite the dangers it has, it is worth it to study. It will be harder to study knowing that you can't take anything from the planet back, or the fact that in order to do anything you need to actually be there on the planet to get a better understanding.
