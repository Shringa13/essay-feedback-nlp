Despite how many set backs people have had with trying to land rovers and other machines on Venus, people are still trying to find a way to gain further knowledge about the planet. With the temperature being set at 800 degrees Fahrenheit, that could be enough alone for human do die. That would be like going into a fire. Even if they managed to build something to with stand higher heat, the atmosphere is made up of 97% carbon dioxide. The planet is practically burning causing carbon dioxide to blanket the whole planet. The atmosphere still stands at a 170 degree temperature. High enough temperature can metal some metals and most materials or burn them.

The author of this article is obviously drawn to exploring Venus to get a better understanding of it. In the last paragraph it is said that "Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation." The authoer is just saying that no matter how big the danger is, even if it is risky, we shouldn't be set back by it. Sometimes, somethings are better left unexplored because it could have risks that people don't even know of. If they are somehow able to make a machine that is able to withstand the harsh climate of Venus, they will want to send a person up there one day won't they? But I human most likely will never be able to withstand those conditions even if they were in a machine that protected them. Heat causes things to expand which can eventually expand the metal enough and expose that person to heat and carbon dioxide.

In conclusion, despite how many times people have tried to land rovers and machines on Venus, they will one day find a way to perfect those machines and may be able to send a person up there to gather further research on the planet.
