Driverless cars, are they all they are made out to be? I think not. The reason being is because it still needs a driver. It watches the driver instead of the road. And you have to be alert at all times.

This "driverless car" should not be called a driverless car. This car still needs a driver. Say your close to a wreck, the "driverless car" will alert you saying it needs you to drive around the wreck. do you really want a non driverless driverless car? I know iI do not.

This car also watches the driver. If it is watching the driver how is it watching the road? It cant do both at once. This is absurd. This car is just not as good as they made it out to be, in my opinion.

According to paragraph eight you have to be alert at all times. Since this car still needs a driver this car can alert you that you need to take the wheel at any given time. Therefore, if you buy this car be very alert.

In conclusion, I would not buy this driverless car for myself because A. it still needs a driver. B. it watches the driver instead of the road. And C. you have to be alert at all times.
