The Electoral college is a place were they elect the presidant of the united states and the congress choose if they put a vote in for that presidant and his people. The process is the selection of electors next the meeting of the electors and then where would they vote for the presidant and the vice presidant and the counting of the electoral votes by congress the elctoral college consists of 538 electors and a majority of 270 electoral votes is required to vote for the presidant. The presidants election is held every four years on a tuesday after the first monday in November.

The presidential election is held at the electoral college i think that why would you have the electoral college when you can just vote some other way insted of having this big thing just to elect the presidant and the vice presidant why can't you just have a regular meeting deciding if you are voting for that presidant and the vice presidant the electoral college to me makes no sense why would you have this big thing that makes no sense at all if you wanted to vote for the presidant then vote i dont get why you have to go through a big system just to vote i think its just easier just to vote a regular way and it takes so long and it also depeneds on what state you are in and how you have to vote in texas if you wanted to vote for a certain person you would have to vote for the slate of 34 or what the number of that person is like for example if you voted for Jhon Kerry you would have to vote for slate of 34 democratic electors it just depends on the state. what if there was a tie the election it would be thrown into the house of representatives where the state delegations vote on the presidant and the vice presidant cause only each state casts one vote a single representatives from Wyoming representing 500,000 voters. this is why i think we should not have the electoral college becuase it causes to much cauase throught all the steps you have to go through it takes so much time up and there is so many other thing we can be focusing on i think the electral college needs to be gone and over with and we need to find other ways to vote for the presidant and the vice presidant.
