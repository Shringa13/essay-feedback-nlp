The face on the planet is just a weird land marking. It was not made by aliens it was only just luck that it was there.

The face that you think is there is just from the land was or an astroid

It it was made by aliens there wouldn't just one face on the planet.

The aliens didn't know what we look like or what a Egypion Pharaoh would look like.

Why would the aliens just make the face and not the body too.

When Michael Malin went up to take a picture of the the face they got a sharper snap for the picture.

There was no alien monuments or landforms for the aliens.

The people who want the face to be made by aliens are not very smart.

If there are aliens and they find out who is watching and trying see if they are real, might come here to hurt or kill us.

If we do find what do you think will happen, we "hi we are from earth we are the ones who spy on you".

First they proubly won't know what we are saying.

And they will most likely want to kill us.

What we found was just a land marking that isn't something to we should mess with.

What you saw was just a land marking that means nothing.

There are no such things as aliens, and if there are such things as aliens we should just leave them alone.
