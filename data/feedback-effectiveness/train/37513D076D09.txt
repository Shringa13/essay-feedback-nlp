Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I think we should make everyone do community service! It could let people have a different aspect on the community. Newton County is not that clean and not everybody is superb in school. I have some thoughts and questions about how you are going to make students do this.

First, Newton County has lots of liter! We have to do something about it. Certain students should be assigned roads and highways and pick up as much trash as possible every Friday! Then we can pride in of county. It will be so much more delightful.

Another idea is to tutor students every other day! If we have eighth grade students tutor sixth and seventh grade students then hopefully our AP scores will improve! Your probably wondering how this will help the eighth graders. Well, you have to know something before you can teach it to somebody else, right? If all eight graders know the material then all of us will have to tutor someone! You can make it required so that everyone will have to learn all the material!

Lastly, I have a concern. I'm not sure how you could make everyone do community service because some students have after school activities and you can't make them stop for other people. Please let me know soon, so I can help you!

Thank you for reading my letter! I hope you consider my ideas. I'm really looking forward to community service. It's a pleasure to be writing to you.

Thank You, STUDENT_NAME
