Studying Venus has the good and the bad. You find out so much about your planet and others. Like whybdonthey call Venus an "Evening Star" when its actually a planet. With Venus being provern a very challenging place to examine, ist hard to find out more abiut it. Studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite that dangers.

One of the big dangers studying Venus is the temperature. Venus is the hottes planet in our solar system. The planets temperature averages over 800 degrees Fahrenheit. The atmospheric pressure is 90 time greater than then on our planet. The conditions are way more extreme then what we've encounter on Earth. In addition to the heat there's erupting valcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightning strikes.

We could be living on Venus. Venus has the most Earth-like planet in our solar system. Venus used to be covered with oceans that could've supported various forms of life. Even today Venus has rocky sediment, valleys, mountains, and craters. Venus is an opttion for a planetary visit.

There are solutions for the temperature. NASA's solution is to let scientist float above the fray. A vehicle hovering 30 miles above the Venusian landscape. It would be like airplanes flying over storms, but in this case its a blimp-like vehicle flying over the 800 degree surface. The vehicle would be thirty-plus miles above the surface. Solar power would be plentful anc radiation would not exceed Earth levels, survivable but not easy conditions.

Trying to meet the challenge by Venus has value. Human curiosity will most likely lead us to many intimidating endeavors. With the dangers studing Venus, helps us incase we need to move to another planet. Studying Venus is dangerous but, it has its perks.
