Do you think driverless cars are better than regular cars ?

If you ask me i think regular cars are better. I also think driverless cars are dangerous. Im going to give you few details why i think regular car are better and driverless cars are dangerous.

My first reason i think regular cars are better is because when driving a regular car you have to pay attention. If your car drive by itself you can lose focus and forget where you was trying to go. Its say in paragraph nine that in five different states its illegal to test computer driven cars. My last reason i like regular cars because it keeps people active.

I think driverless cars are dangerous because it has way more technolgy. If driving and you car glitch and brake on it on it may cause accident. Another reason i think its dangerous is because with all that technolgy it can cause a easy fire.

Those are my reasons i think regular cars are better, and driverless cars useless if you still have to put gas in it. Now write me a essay on if you think driverless cars are better then regular cars.
