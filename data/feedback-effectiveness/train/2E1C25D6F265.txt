Vote for me the other guy whats to take all your money no vote for me he fail english in high school thats al you hear when its voteing time. they put them all over  like  the malls sides of roads. Its all stupid they saying things to make eachother look bad but that the end of the day no one is perfect. So what he did in his passed and in high school is just pointless to bring up. As teens and kids we do stuoid stuff but we do grow up so why bring it back up to make you feel better about your self. this is what i really dont get we the people are suppost to vote to see who will be leading us for the next four years but we really are not. We all vote but then if the electoral college chocies some one else that who it is so what is the point in us votin. If even when we the people vote for this person and he wins with us and yall want the other guy he wins thats not fair to him or us. It should be popular votes take all. did you know that when you vote for your canidate you are actally voting for your candidates electors. Then our governor prepares a certificate of ascertainment they all so decllare the winning presidential candidate. I think its all just not worth it all that work for what if we could just vote on who we want and the person that gets the most votes wins.  I dont understnd why this have to have all that other stuff that is not needed. They say the electoral college restpres some of the weight in the political balance. They have 538 electors whats the point if we the people could just vote why i really dont understand whats the need for them the person with most votes wins i dont see why all that other stuff is nesseasy. I know you people probley think im crazy but i dont care it just dont seem to me like there is apoint for all of that this is just how i see it in y point of veiw
