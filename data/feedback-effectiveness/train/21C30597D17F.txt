Dear Senator,

I'd like to take some of your time to shed some light on the matter of having popular vote for the president of the United states."We the people " ,That stands strong in our society and I'd like it to stay that way.Majority of the people,Thats what its about.Over 60% have voted to have popular vote to elect our president.Thats over half,and numbers speak.Yes,The electoral college has its good but over all bad,There is so much trust put into each states electors and some voters dont even know it.

The number one fault in the electoral college is the electors themselfs.Most voters get confused and have no idea how the electoral college works,better yet that we vote for our electors.The electors we do vote for by chossing the canidate by popualor vote,sometimes dont vote for their party .(The majority of the states residents) ,That means who the people wanted they arent even promised the vote for.

I understand the good in the electoral college though.It helps keep states from tieing ,and causing chaos.But,We the people do not have our justice in that manner.If the winning vote is casted by state the legislatures are techinally responsible for picking the eletors in favor of the vote.Then when it comes time to fairly make their votes for us,the people who voted ,They can change their minds if they like an vote for the least liked canidate running for office by Florida is they wanted too! Thats ridicoulous and has no justice.The winner takes all system is very faulty and unfair.

I'm sorry if I have wasted any of your time but I felt this matter is important to the USA."We the people",Anyone past middle school can tell you where the beggining of that sentence came from.If we want to keep America fair and keep our pride in our country we should most defaintly start electing our presidents by popular vote,instead of relying on an out dated system that has many faults and injustce as I have pointed out.Thank you for your time.

Sincerly,
