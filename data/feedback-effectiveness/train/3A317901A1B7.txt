Sir,

I believe that doing community service is a good thing to do for others, but I also believe that people should be able to do what they want or need to do.

so I think we should at least vote to it. That way it will be a fair decision by the people for the people. It would be good to clean up trash or help others, but people also like spending their time on their own terms, therefore a vote in favor or not in favor would be best.

Another good idea would be to have a meeting with parents and teachers and see what they think of this, kids love to play video games, watch T.V. and sit around now, because it's more fun to them then cleaning up trash, or helping someone out, I am Against doing community service, but if you chose any of the ideas in this letter, it's up to the students, the teachers, and the parents now.

Sincerely, STUDENT_NAME
