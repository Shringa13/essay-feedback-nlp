The Face isn't an alien artifact. It wasn't created by aliens, it's just a natural landform on Mars. If it was created by aliens NASA would've already found out. There is no real evidence that aliens did it, only in Hollywood movies, and books. Though some people think otherwise.

Aliens arn't the reason the Face is on Mars. Nasa has went on three missions to Mars to take pictures. Each time they went there has been no trace of aliens. Also NASA upgraded their camaras each time they went to Mars. So the pictures were more clearer.

On the second mission NASA went on, the camaras proved it was a natural landform. Though other scientist belived alien markings were being hidden by wispy clouds. This is because it was winter in Mars during the time NASA went. Still NASA went on a third trip to make its point. This time they used their most advanced camera yet and took crystal clear pictures of the Face.

The pictures reaveled it was a Martian equivalent of a butte. This is a common landform around the American West. This couldn't be caused by aliens because Mars could've caused this landform to appear. Just like in the American West. Still people think that the alien markings are still there.

Overall aliens could'nt of caused this landform. There is no evidence of aliens being on Mars. There is only fiction stories about it, and on radio talk shows. NASA has went on three missions to prove it's a natural landform, and they were'nt able to find alien markings. If this isn't enough evidenve to convince someone they must be a big alien fan.
