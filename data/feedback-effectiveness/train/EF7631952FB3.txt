When you think about Venus ,do you think about Oceans or Mountains? With the new and the old technology they can figure just about anything out. Venus is considered Earths "Twin", but should it be

Venus is know to be one of the more dangerous planets, but it should not. In the passage paragraph 4 it says " Long ago, venus was probably covered largerly with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth." This is showing that Venus hasnt always been bad, or dangerous becase it used to be just like Earth. Humans live on Earth so Humans could have lived on Venus, which makes it not dangerous.

Another reason Venus should not be considered dangerous is becase of the technology they can use to see if it is ok for people to be there. In the 1800s they used to use mechanical computers. This device could do calculations. In the passage in paragraph 7 it says " These devices make calculations by using gears and levers and do not require electronics at all." This is showing that technology can help people see if the planet is dangerous or not by using the power and flexible and quick power it has.

In conclusion Venus should not be considered dangerous. In todays time our technology has improved and its surface has goten to be mountains, valleys, and craters. All in all Earth and Venus are twins.
