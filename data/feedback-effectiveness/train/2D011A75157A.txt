Dear Senator Whatever,

I infact am not for Electoral College or changing election by popular vote. I don't like that if you vote for one person, the rest comes with, that's rediculous, what if I want this president but not all his stupid underseers, then what? Another thing,Â  I also dont love how they get to choose a giant room full of democratic dictators, and have them vote, and if they vote differently than the people, then we are forced to go with their choice. That completley demolishes the idea of our freedom of voting. If they dissagree your gonna throw it to the representatives before back to the people who are the real back bone of this country?!?!"Perhaps the most worrying is the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote. In that case, the election would be thrown to the House of Representatives, where the state delegations vote on the president."

"The American pople should conciderthemselves lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century; the system allows for much worse. Concider that the state legislatures are techinically responsible for picking electors, and those electors could always defy the people."

I myself am a libertairian and i dont much like that this test is asking of me to do something storngly against my belifs and i just think is plain aweful.

All government is inefective and should be dissolved.
