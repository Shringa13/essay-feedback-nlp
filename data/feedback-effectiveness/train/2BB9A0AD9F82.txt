The Electoral College is something that should be kept for our government voting system. When people vote for the president and are not really voting for their president they want, they should be able to directly vote for the person they want to win. With the Electoral College in place, you are not able to do so. Their should be two forms of voting.

When the poll is taking place, people should place their votes and have those be shipped off to the Electoral College and have the votes be taken there. But, their should be another copy for the votes to be casted directly to the election. This will help when someone wins electoral vote and loses national popular vote and the other way around. It can still happen to where someone wins elecotoral votes and wins national popular vote. With this method, their will be fewer debate over who should truly be the president they choose.

If any of these options are off of the table, then their should be a law that their should be no winner-takes-all majority voting. When 49% of the state want one president to win and 51% want the other, that should be equally distributed across the presidential election. When there is that little of a gap in between votes, that is the reason why people win national popular vote over electoral votes right there. People should obviously get the president that they want their country to be watched over by, but there should be a little change in how that president comes to be.

To be president, you need to catch the peoples eye and try to do great things for your country. People who vote for you, obviously want you to be there president and have you take care of them. When you win the electoral college votes, but lose the national popular votes, that means you have lost the election. This is another reason why the winner-takes-all majority vote for the electoral college should be taken off of the table.
