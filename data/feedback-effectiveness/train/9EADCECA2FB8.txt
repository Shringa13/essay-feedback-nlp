i think that students should have cell phones at passing time and lunch time so these students can relax and they don't have to get their phones taken away and they don't have a problem and they need to put their cell phones on vibrate or turned off but students don't want to put their phones in their lockers cause they get stolen which they get mad and they need to buy another one.

students needs their phones so they can contact their family if some thing happens or their family get robbed then how are you going to communicate. cell phones are okay but students are always texting during class when teachers are teaching. the cell phones company are starting to make new cell phones and people are starting to buy fancy phones like droid so are the students. cell phones are very cool to have and its kind of a lot of money to pay for those fancy phones. all students are buying cool phones cause they think they are cool cause other kids has cheap ones and telling them their phones are ugly. students are mean cause they could use someone's number and tell them awful stuff and would say the same thing what they say. so i say lets not have cell phones at school that would be okay to me.
