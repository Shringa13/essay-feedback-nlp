The author is very convinceing he didnt just say whats good nor did he say all what is bad.

From the text he made the evidce of how Venus has made it difficult to walk on or be near. He siad that the prussure and the heat is even difficult for the bots that scincetist had made.

He also siad that NASA is compelling an idea that sends human to study Venus. they are trying to make a blump-like vehicle 30 or so miles above the rollong venusian. It would still be 170 degess fahrenheit. Thought the presuure would only be as sea levels on earth.

NASA even may bring old technology called Mechanical Cumputers they were first envisiond in the 1800s and played and important role in the 1940 during World War ll. they are not like the smart phones or cumputers we have. Mechanical Cumputerscan can last in heat even longer. They work with gears and levers.

The author did make good points. Which are convinceing and to be honest I wish I would go now just to see what it looks like. He proved that there is more then one way to prove that we can study venus even if we cant see it in person.
