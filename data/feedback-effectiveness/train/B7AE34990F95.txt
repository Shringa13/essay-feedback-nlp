as the author said " studying venus is a worthy pursuit despite the danger it presents". its also called the " evening star" is one of the brightest points of light in the noght sky, and its also the esecound planet from ourr sun, its simple to see from the distant but safe vantage point ofpoint of Earth, it has proved a very challnenging place to examine more closely.

And its also called the Earth's twin, becues the closest plant to shape like earth in tearms of density and size, and its the closeset plant to earth, somtimes its vence that closest to earth and somtimes its Mars, humans tried sending space crafts to land on venus, but none of them manged to servive the landing for more then few hours and that explains why no speaceship manged to go there yet for more then three decades. and thats why human need to study it more more.

one of the reasons it have een chalnging to use to reach mars becues it has an atmosphere of almost 97% carbon dioxide becues the cllouds of corrosive sulfuric acid in venus's atmosphere. and its also very hot there the temreture reaches "800f' and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater then what we experience on our own planet. these conditions are far more extreme than anything humans encouunter on earth; such as enviroment would crush even a submarine accustomes to diving to the deepest parts of our oceans and would liquefy many metals. and it has the hottest surffece if any plant, and also a while ago Venus had ocians just like earth and it could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth.

and thats why we need too study venus more becues if anything happend to earth we might have a secound place to live in.
