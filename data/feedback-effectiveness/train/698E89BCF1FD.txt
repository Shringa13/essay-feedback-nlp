Hey there Principal Generic_Name, I would like to say that I personally disagree with you.

I disagree because some students may already have an a extracurricular activity outside of school and because many of the students parents may not have the money to pay for any extracurricular activity.

For one, many students often already have extracurricular activities outside of school that they love to do.

Such as, playing baseball, football, basketball, dancing, and other activities.

So, if all the students have to participate in extracurricular activities after school.

Many students won't be able to do the activities they love during outside of school.

And most importantly, some students parents may not have the money to provide to the school for the extracurricular activities.

Most of the time when you are playing a sport you have to pay for your jersey, cleats, and other things you need to play that sport, and also the dues that come with playing that sport.

But first, you got to consider that many parents are probably struggling with paying the bills, putting clothes on their child back or children, paying for food, and other things that children need.

So, I hope that you put into consideration that before just saying that every student have to do an extracurricular activity after school.

Be sure that every student have everything they need for that activity, everything is alright at home, and other things that will help the student do that extracurricular activity.

If not, I hope you reconsider about any extracurricular activity for all the students.
