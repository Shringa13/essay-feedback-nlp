Dear mr. senator i think that we should keep the electoral college eclections. I believe the electoral college is a better system than any other. Some of my reasoning is it is the easiest way to elect someone. Second reason is it is very fast quick to elect. Final reason is it work fine. My mom always tells me you dont fix whats not broke. This method has worked for a very long time.

If a method like this has worked thid long i think we should keep it until it doesnt work. Then when it stops working we could start a new type of election. Many people have used this type of election the whole life and we still use it today so i think we should keep this way of our elections. The first reason is it one of the easiest ways to elcet. In the story it says the "electoral college process consists of the selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors is where they vote for the president and vice president , and the counting of the electoral votes by congress.

My second reason is it is very fast. They get the electoral votes in and start counting. Within a couple of hours they have tha answer. they can find out who wins in just a couple of weeks. My final reason is it works good. If it didn't work good it still wouldn't be around today. in the story it says that the electoral college was established by our founding fathers. So i think this is the process we should use to elect our people even if it is still an old way of doing things.
