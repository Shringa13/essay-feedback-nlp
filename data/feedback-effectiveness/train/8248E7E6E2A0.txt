SCHOOL_NAME is changing gym rules about how we can't participate in gym only if we have a B average.

I think that the new rules are kind of bad because everyone should get there workout no matter what ! so kids can stay healthy. Also because really that's a students free time because we get to run around and just be free instead of sitting in the classroom all day long.

Instead of them rules I think they should make a better rule. So we don't have to dress for gym or something at least like that Because getting a B average can be hard to do sometimes if you don't like that pacific class or if your not good at that subject. I think if this does happen students would really be upset because almost everyone likes gym because we do a lot of fun stuff in there and everyone should get a workout so yeah.. I think having gym at school is the most important because that's the only free time we ever get while we are in school.

If we was to end up having gym rules where we couldn't participate only if we had a B average nobody would even want to go to gym because most people don't get A's and B's so the average of people not participating would be horrible!.
