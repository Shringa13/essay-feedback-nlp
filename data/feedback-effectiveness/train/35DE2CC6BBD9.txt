Dear principal,

I think it is a good idea for the student's to be in community service. It will help the environment so the earth can be healthy. I knew a friend that was in community service in 2009 he now lives in Rosemont, Illinois he picked up trash all over were he lives. But some of the students don't want to do something like this to prevent gases of pollution on earth.

I have been trying to make people under stand what it mean's to help. They don't want to help because they just want to litter throw can's not recycle or any thing to help. What I need are some people that care to do some of the community service. Take Disney's friend for change they are helping kid's unpollute there town's or cities.

What we really need are some special people to help for this community service one's that care for there planet. these crises on our planet need to stop all what they have done. i have received a letter from my friend that moved to Illinois has cleaned up the whole city with some help in just 1 month. If you know any one who can help with this call.

This is my idea what we should do to help our community. I now like to other people to see what life really mean's to us. We need miracles in Fayette county to help. I believe that we can do it. Just one more thing will you take a stand.

Sincerely, STUDENT_NAME
