Dear, Senator PROPER_NAME

My name is PROPER_NAME and i am attending SCHOOL_NAME in LOCATION_NAME.

I have recently been learning about the electoral college. i have been learning alot about it, actually, and i have to say. the electoral college sounds like a really bad idea!

First off, swing states? that sounds completely unfair. sure its good for states like Texas, California, and New york. but what of the smaller states like Montana, or Maine, or Wyoming even? they deserve as much of a voice as the others.

Also, this is presidency here, not what game we should play in Gym! majority vote makes absolutely NO sense whatsoever. I mean come on, we are deciding the next LEADER of our country! Again. everyones wishes should be accounted for.

Now im not saying that popular vote is perfect either but it sure beats the college. there are too many variables for the college. too many areas where something can go wrong. If something gets tied then they just throw the vote to the house of represenitives. I think if there is a tie that it should result in a re-election. But thats probably just me (personally i think it should be like the hunger games).

Well thats really all I have to say. I hope you read this letter and maybe you can send it to your superiors or whoever it is you work for to get my letter read by the President. And see if we can fix this problem here.

Yours Truly,

PROPER_NAME
