In these 3 sources they're talking about electoral college, I beileve electoral college is a good and smart way to handle elections. AN electoral college is a process made by the founding fathers and they estabilshed it in the constitution. Some people planned on abolishing it, I think thats and i'll show you why.

First,I beileve they should not abolish it because its so origanal and whats the reason it needs to be abolished. They're probably planning on making a new system or doing it for a personal matter. Either way, its all depending if the congress and the president himself to agree on this. Overall abolishing a this from the constitution where its been for too long is wrong. Even though this method is not democratic its still not right to abolish this from the constitution.

And, I also know why they are some reasons why they wouldn't want this method to be here. In source 2 it stated "voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of the electors". Everything depends on the state because it decides most of the voting standards of the whole state. This method can also defy the will of the people, sounds anti-republican and just wierd for legislatures to screw with the votes you jotted down. This practictly almost made JFK not a president apparently he got lucky. Richard Nixon voted aand validated his predidency.

In a nutshell, electoral college has its upsides and downsides and is still up today. I beileve its an easy thing to say it all depends on opinion and beilefs.
