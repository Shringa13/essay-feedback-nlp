Advice, The act of sharing wisdom between people. Advice is one of the core foundations of human culture and one of the ways as humans to transfer information between people, but one of the flaws of advice is that it could be wrong. One way to get that variable out of the way is to as more that one person. Most of the time this get rid of the people that don't know what their talking about or are just flat out wrong. When I was in second grade I had to go to the bathroom, so i asked my friend (also in second grade) where the bathroom was. My friend pointed at the art room not the bathroom, so when i asked my teacher where the bathroom was she said is was right across the hall. The lesson to take out of this is more then one person can be got to get the wrong out of the equation.

Advice is an opinion, opinions have bias in them. Asking more that one person can help cut down that bias by adding other opinions in to a big pool making one bias less of a influence then what is was before you got more opinions, making your choice more accurate. In conclusion more then one opinion is always going to be better then just one.
