I don't think students would be benefit from being able to attend classes from home.

Because, students who stays home must of the time they will turn Lizzy, and they're not going to do work.

Also, they will be behind, and it will be hard for them to study by them self.

As a result, when you have people who are trying to study, you going to be in the mood by doing work and getting homework done. such as, their is a lot of would help other students by homework and other things.

For students who does online school will not have teachers to help them if they need by studying for a quiz or a classwork.

so going school it will be easier to study because they going to have teachers.

And be living the moment, which is going to make most of the students study more, because they going to have students and teachers and be studying as a team.

As a result, at school you not just learning from the teachers, you also will learn from other students new things.

Also, at school you will find a guidance to help you by scheduling for classes, and piking the right classes.

If you are planing for college the guidance will help you by getting scholarship from college or sports team.

Also, for students who like to play sports will have the chance to play sports with school team, and will help them by getting a scholarship.

So if students stay home must of the time it will be hard for them to have relationships by having friends.

That will be a problem by studying because the only thing they are doing is studying so it's going to be boring.

As a result if they need help by searching they can go to the library, and they will find what they are looking for But, at home they will only thing they have Google search from.
