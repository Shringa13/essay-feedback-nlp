Dear Principal,

I think every student should be prerequisite to do at least two hours of community services. Community services is a commendable thing to do because we all are helping out the community by helping little kids such as tutoring or cleaning up your neighborhood for a cleaner earth.

Some people might just think community service takes too much time away from what they have to do and is a waste of time. But by doing community services each of us is doing something subsidiary. I think if we all do this we can make our community a better place to live in and i assure your that after doing so many good and helpful things toward others, in the end you will feel and be a better person.

Community services is also good because it is sometimes prerequisite for some high schools and colleges, which will make you look like a better person, being part of the community. Community Services isn't all that bad because at the end of the day, you just got to think back and realize how much you did and how that will make a difference to someone you helped or change something you did.

Some types of community services; is volunteering at the hospital helping clean up litter by the road sides or side walk. Even helping out at your church or just going to the nursing home to help. All this and much more will help you serve in the community and be a better person.

I think if it is imperative for all students to perform community services, that it'll make the school look like a better place and so will the students. This is a way of good form and will be various different type of community services for every different student to choose from every student should at least pick two different types of services to do.
