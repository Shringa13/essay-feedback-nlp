Dear Mr principal,

I think students are require to take community service because it helps them get organized. It also helps out the community to be more cleaner. For example doing community service helps kids stay out of trouble such as gangs, violence, and drugs. Also it helps kids to be more disciplined, more respectful, more caring for our planet, more careful, more safe, and more mature. One Example is that kids who do community service are more organize. Community service is helpful to kids that get bored at home.

Sometimes people think that doing community service is just a waste of time because they don't want to do it or they think that it is just boring. But community service can show you new things. Such as taking care for the elderly, taking care of the planet, respecting others, and helping others. One last thing about community service is that it makes our community look more better than others, and it helps our community to be better for the people that live in our community. Those are my reasons on why our school should do community service.

Sincerely, STUDENT_NAME
