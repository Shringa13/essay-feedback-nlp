This essay is on if I think the use of technlogy to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable . I believe It is valuable and heres why .

I believe the use of tehcnology to read students expressions is valuable because as a studnt myslf i know how it feel to have to do a computer assignment and not get whats going on or its moving to fast so u get frustrated or angry .If they were able to put that in school computers i feel more kids will do better in school . Like if my facial exprassions are showing a teacher some they cant really get it because they are humans ad they cant really read faces s good as a computer could . Now on the other hand you have this computer that when i look confused it is willing to slow down or break things down more simplier for me and me only .

I feel sometimes thats all kids need is extra help because honestly im a student that needs extra help thats only a little bit of the reasons why i think that is valuable . Students facial expressions show everything you need to know you just have to get something to catch them . Of course they are going to have to make sure its spot on . What if i completely understanding everything and then they start to break it down then what ? Because tehcnology is not perfect .

That is a counter arguement someone can make . What if my facial expression is showing one thing but im feeling a different way . Technology always has a bug or something that nees to be fixed . So whoeer makes this needs to make sure that it is perfect .

Thats why i think this ablility to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable .
