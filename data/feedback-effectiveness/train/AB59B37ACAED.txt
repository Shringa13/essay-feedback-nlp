DEAR,state senator i argue in favor of keepingÂ  the electoral votes alive to choose for the new turn. people say that the electoral voting system may turn alot of potential voters away from voting for a new president since the electoral voting has been tight on alot of people who don't like to use that way then they want it as a direct election and to abolish the electoral college!

There are alot of ways we can actually save the eletoral voting system .the electoral voting consists of a very non-democratic way so all the voters can decide on a canindate for whoever receives the most highest votes on,in 2000 gore had way more votes than bush but fewer electoral votes on him andthat was since they first ever voting for the presidents back in around 1888 thats a very long time almost 200 years when that happened. basically we need to keep the electoral voting for some practical reasons thta we do not know about now maybe it could be from thedispute over recent years of voting .

or we can choose a different option then electoral voting maybe instead of the canindates to get voted by a party we should just vote on a popular vote that we should rely on next time it comes around
