Dear,

State senator, i believe that we should keep the electoral college because it it not only benifits congress it aso benifits the president who is running to be our leader as well and also our electors.

The electoral college has been made from our founding fathers in the constitution it shows a meaning, a meaning not only to us but also to The United states and in the most part its total strangers who pick these people its a political party  it may seem unfair that the votes we are putting in is for the electors to run but its a show of value it shows the the electors get help with votes and so does the president just like it may be in the other side of the green grass as well.

"The Electoral college avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast"(pg22). Obama gotten 61.7 percent of the electoral votes while Romney got 51.3 it seems of electors in the electorial college knew what the were doing now my gas prices isnt over 3 dollars a gallon near me  "almost all of the states award electoral votes on a winner-takes -basis"(pg18) not only a predident is just not chosen it is a meeting that takes place where they go throughly to pick the vice prsident or the president.

In each state the cadinate that is running for that paticular has their own group of electors that in safe hands its a great thing to know that people that are being chosen are being reviewed by state laws as well to be exact and either way we help choose our state electors its not about the specific people its about all of us and how we contributre to the votes to our candinates in the electoral college we are not only helping the electors the electors are helping the presidnt as well and most of all we are helping United State Of America Founding Fathers.
