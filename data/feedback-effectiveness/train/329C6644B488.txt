Dear Principal ,

February 1st

I personally think that by you changing the school policy it would make it hard for all the people that enjoy sports with a "C" average to even enjoy the activities . I believe that you should not change the school policy because the most kids that enjoy playing academic sports such as Basketball, Track , Cheerleading, Football, soccer ,etc. they wouldn't get a chance to play because the new rule you trying to enforce . I think sports isn't just for everyone with a " B" average it should be for everyone that would like to play as long as the have a good grade point average.

As far as the new policy goes I disagree because i feel everybody should be able to participate in activities . This is their time to represent with good character and attitude and also have fun and enjoy their time at school . Instead of not being able to play for having a "C" grade point average . They have shown effort and that is all that is required is that all students show effort. This makes Learning and education more interesting.

Also I feel as though it helps to keep the students motivated and on the right path knowing they have a reward to look forward to as the go on the field or the track or court. This keep their confidence goes up and the are more energetic to learn and be ready to work and other thing . I also disagree that the new policy be in place because not all people have a passion for the same thing and not all students can keep a "B" average while working or while playing a sport . This is my opinion on why i believe we should keep our current policy and the both "B &C" average students play sports as well as the others .

Thanks You for listening and taking my thought into consideration on changing and keeping the policy accurate . I believe this will help all students to stay focus . Last I think this policy is a motivator because it will help them to accomplish more than what the thought they could.

Sincerely STUDENT_NAME :]
