Dear, senator

I believe we should start using the popular vote method. I like this method its mostly the peoples vote getting credit and not the elector's. So whoever were in a election with the popular it would because of the peoples prefences.

In a election with popular vote the majority of the peoples vote will win. Which in sence makes it fair. In a electoral college every state gets its own number votes and thats the president and others are voted for today. The electoral college consist of 538 votes and need a majority of 270 for them to get heir winner. Also "under the 23rd amendment  of the constitution, the district of coumbia is allocated 3 electors and treated like a state for purpose of the electoral college".

If oneday we adapt the popular vote the of this nation would be so satisfied with their vote because your is worth more in a sence. our states wouldn't have to have a certain number of votes they can have. The people will do the voting for them. sence the people will be doing the voting for them, whoever will have the majority of the people. on a side note you cant keep everyone happy. but there would be the majority happy.

In conclusion that's why i beleieve we go to the method of popular vote. The biggest portion of the people will be happy and there be a longer process in picking our next and future president sincerely, your boy a
