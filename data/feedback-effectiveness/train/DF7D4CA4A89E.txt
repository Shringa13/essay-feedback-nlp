Technology can make people mad in happy its just how you use it in how you do it like you can look up things that you know that will make you happy. But in this story its saying that the computers know when you happy or sad or even confused but then it can help the person because it say it can modify. Its a lot that the technology it can't look you in the face in see that something is wrong with you. The story is saying they want to know how people are feeling even when they are trying to hide it i think that is personal and the person will tell you if the person wanted you to know. But technology is good in so many ways but its bad in so many ways to. I think your emotions shoud stay to you if thats what you want and not base on if the technology want to know.
