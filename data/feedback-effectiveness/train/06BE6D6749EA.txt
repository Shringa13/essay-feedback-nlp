There once was three citizen friends from boston who wanted who wanted to limit car usage to 70 percent they realized it was a good idea because it'll help people avdanced experiment in low-car suburban life but its basic precepts are being adopted around the world in attempts to make suburbs more compact and more accessible to public transportation with less parking space in this new approach stores are far away to walk to on a main street rather than in small malls around some distant highway at the same time its a good idea because if they give up their cars therre will less traffic no accidents or any parking space and it will be less problems with people they think if they give up there cars there will be a safer street for everyone but some people didnt like idea because if they give up there cars they wont be able to get to their jobs on time and at the same some people live to far from jobs and homes that they want keep people driving their cars       Â
