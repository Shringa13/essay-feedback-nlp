I am a scientist at NASA my name is Jeff. There is a face on mars and people think its by aliens well I know its not by aliens. It is just a natural landform on mars its nothing big it wasnt made by aliens and a lot of people think its by aliens and then a lot of people agree with me also.

This face on mars is a natural landform anything can happen on a planet that we have'nt been on yet. We do not know what this planet is capble of and whats on the planet of mars. Well I think that it wasnt made by aliens becuase it gets more noticable by the years pass then it dissappers in a different year. Well Im sure our planet looks different from space in different years.

Why would aliens even want to put a face on the planet. Im sure if there was aliens on mars they would'nt be carving a face on there own planet. Im sure there living there life on mars not knowing we even exsit thats if there is aliens on there. They wouldnt what anything with us if they did I think they would have made more signs then just two dots and a straight line and they would have made the face more noticable and it dissapears after a couple of years that is probbaly of there is wind or something that might have blew away they face. We had our best people look into it and they think its a landform to they got pictures and eveidence that its just a regular landform!
