Dear Principal,

There has been a lot of talk going around about if you're going to decide to require community service or not. So, I decided to write this letter to you hoping it will make your decision a little easier. I would agree, that there is a lot of controversy over this issues.

My opinion on this issue is to require community service to all of the students of our school. Community Service is just helping out the community, but its also helping out helping the person doing the service. The individual student may not realize it, but community make the place THEY live in a better society. If it didn't it would be called, world service. Everyone doing a little bit can make a big impact in our community.

Some students may say "but, I just don't have time". In most cases this is a lie. What these kids are saying is, on a rough estimation, in 3,600 hour school year the don't have just 10 hours of that time to give back to their community? I find that pretty hard to believe, and I hope you would to. I have to agree that students lives are very full these days, but the can make time for their community that makes there lives full. On my opinion on refusing to do community service is either the person is lazy, or just plain mean. The students may not realize it not, but community is definitely worth their time. After doing community service, the students will have a satisfying feeling, knowing they did something good, and benefited their community. You never know, they just might like community service.

I want to thank you for reading this letter and hearing what I have to say and my opinion on community service. I hope this letter will make your decision a little less stressful, either option you pick. You do a great at your job and I know you'll make your decision for the better of the school. Thank you for reading this letter.

Sincerely,

Your student
