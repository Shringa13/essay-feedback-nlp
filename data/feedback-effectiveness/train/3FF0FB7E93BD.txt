Dear Principal,

I think that students should go perform community service. It will give these students a good education and idea or what he or she would like to do in life. Weather is would be tutoring elementary school children, or help clean up liter for the Earth to become a better planet. Community service would be a thing to get your mind off of things. And if you have a sport you could go after that sport, or before that sport to perform community service. If I were you, I would let the students choose for them selves. If i was in this position I would choose to do community service to get to know a little about what i am learning. Our community is very important for helping our environment by cleaning up and recycling everything that needs recycled. Education is good it will show you what you want to do before you start you job you went to college for.
