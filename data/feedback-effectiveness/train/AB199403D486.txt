Is Venus a worthy pursuit despite the danger, I say no because Venus is over 800 degrees fahrenheit and the pressure is 90 thimes greater than what we had to experience on planet Earth.

First the text states ¨ These conditions are far more extreme than anything humans encounter on Earth, such an enviorment wuld crush even a submarine accustomed to diving to deepest parts of our oceans and would liquefy many metals.¨(Paragraph 3) The quote is saying is event though our planet can mealt things Venus can mealt is a lot faster than Earth can.

Then the test also states ¨Venus has the hottest surface temperatures of any planet in our solar system, even though Mercury is closer to our sun. Beyond high pressure and heat, Venusian geology and weather present additional impediments like erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and freguent lightning strikes to probes seeking to land on its surface.¨(Paragraph 3) The test is saying even though Mercury is the closet planet to the sun Venus has the highest preasure and heat and Benusin geology and weather presents additional impendiments like valcanos, earthquakes, and freguent lighting so it? hard for scienetist to land rockests on Venus.

So when you asked me if Venus is worthy pursuit despite the dangers My anwser will still my no because there are still thing on Venus we don know about. And even though scientist are trying to take new egimpment up tho Venus it still going to be tough to still figure out what still up their in Venous.
