Dear TEACHER_NAME

My opinion would have to be Policy 2 because you are at school to learn for a better education and not to be texting your friends during lunch because probably four fifths of your friends are all ready at school and why would you want to text them if you are sitting by them. Another reason is that if you give kids an opportunity to text during lunch then they would take advantage of texting and they would text during the school day and not pay attention in class. If it was my opinion I would not have cell phones in my pocket so i can call my mom when i get to school otherwise you do not need your phone to text during school hours. That is my opinion on have weather to have your phone on for lunch or not having your phone on at all during the school day.
