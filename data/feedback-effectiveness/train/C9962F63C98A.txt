One way we know that is was now created by aliens i that there was no sign of them when we went to Mars.

Plus we know that it is to hot for there to be living creatures.

Most all of us have has known that mars broke away from the sun that is why it is so hot there. Mars is a big hit in movies, books, magazines, and talk raidio shows.

Some of the people that has went to Mars have taken pictured of what looks like faces in the outer layer of the planet.

How we knew Mars is off of the sun is that it is close to it and it looks identical in almost all the ways possible.

Mars is called the red planet cause of its enormous amount of red on it.

which leads to say it is from the sun.

Plus it is close to 100+ degrees on the planet plus the heat of the sun doesn't help that at all.

Researcher still wanna way to find out how to make it where people can live on any of the planets.

But there is one problem there is no oxygen up in space so those up there would die in a matter of seconds.

I think Mars could be a bad planet to keep going on cause there are more things thhat can go wrong up there. They risk lives every time they r up in space.

If one thing is done incorrect the hole thing fails and then some lives amy be lost.

That is all i have to say about this topic of Mars.
