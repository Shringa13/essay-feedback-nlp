Community services is what helps keep Detroit safe in the time most. I would like to do community service to keep my hometown from going straight into the ground. This reading selection takes me back to my fifth grade, and everyday my friends and I would help some kindergartner's read and sound out word. Books like Green Eggs & Ham, the Cat in The Hat, even Nursery rhymes. Later, on that school when i graduated from the fifth grade me and my friends were rewarded for our help. Right now i have a cousin that just graduated from high school last year, and tutor from grades 1st-5th. He's been doing this for 6 years. Most of the kids he tutored are now in middle school and still talks about him every time I see them. Then, littering isn't my thing i have never just threw some trash on the ground. See I feel like i' m to intelligent or well mannered to just dirty up Detroit anything our should be trying to clean up our lovely city. Detroit has some of the biggest stars from the past, present, and future coming stars that's inside of I.usm nothing but 15 years old and i feel as if its up to me too Detroit back to its legendary statue. I do lots of things to do in my life, like play the bass guitar, play in my schools jazz band, play in my schools orchestra club, and with all of these talents i have i can teach them to some one out on the street and help the community by getting all of these hoodlums off the dangerous Detroit street and bring them to talents that they never knew that had. For the ones that don't want to help Detroit get better then oh well because my City, my Home, my Heart, and my Family Is Detroit, Michigan.
