Dear Senator,

We should be changing to the election by popular vote for the president of the United States. Everyone should just vote for the vice president and the president. People are voting for the Electoral college while they should be voting to see who will be their new president. The electoral college is getting more votes than the president should be getting. Insead of having to have about 270 eletoral votes they should just see which president gets the most votes.

Therfore, the eletoral college mut be stopped and we shall just vote for the presient and vice president. The president should be able to be president for 5 years if they reach a good amount of votes. With eletoral college its sometimes hard to chose the president because they are getting tied with the eletoral votes. I say that the president and the electers should be the ones to pick the vice president. The vice president shall approve of the president also.

Also if someone is running for president and the other person wins they shouldn't be upset because they still will get another chance. One reason some people chose to have the electoral vote is because the president is winning everything. And the electoral college requires a presidental candidate. To them the president isn't their president. The winner/ the president gets all the awards and receive the most infromation. Bigger states are getting more attention the all other states. Some states are not getting any votes at all. Also candidates are getting the same amount of votes, but differnent amount of electoral vote. They want to see who gets the most votes to be the president the most electoral votes. People vote so they can have a perference.

In conclusion, we should change the election by popular vote for the president of the United States. The president should be easier to chose and should be chosen equally and fairly.
