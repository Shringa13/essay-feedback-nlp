Dear,Senator Of Florida

You should keep the Electoral College because the founding fathers of the United States Of America established it when they made the constitiution. The Electoral College helps the selection of the electors where citizans of the United States Of America vote for presidant and vice president. You should also keep the electoral college because alot of people help with the Electoral College. If you the Senitor Of Florida take the Electoral College away 538 electors will lose there job and more. The president needs a majority of 270 electoral votes these votes come from the Electoral College.

The 23rd admendment of the Constitution the District Of Columbia is allowed to have 3 electors. These electors are treated liike a state for purposes of the electoral college. Each canadate running for president in your state has his or her own group of electors. If the Electoral College these people wouldent have their jobs. The presidential election is held every four years on the Tuesday after the first Monday in November. We the people of the UUnited states Of America help choose our states electors. After the presidential election our govener prepares a Certificate Of Ascertainment. This cerificate lists all of the canadates who ran for president.

At ther most basic level the Electoral College is unfair to voters because of the Winner take All syaytem in each state, because of this durning the 2000 campain seventeen states did not see there canadates at all. The Electoral College is outdated and unfair. It is also irrational.
