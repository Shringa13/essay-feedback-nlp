The Facial Action Coding System is a new form of technology that enables computers to identify human emotions. Will the use of this technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable? No. " FACS" will not be valuable to read the emotional expressions of students. A theory and technology such as emotions and the emotional state of someone should be based off of science instead of being based off opinion. Take a minute and compare this new piece of technology to a quiz given on the internet to see what celebrity I would be. Moral of the story if the person can fake it, they can make it. Someone can make believable facial expressions all day does not mean they are happy, sad, or any other emotion based on what they look like. A student may come in looking grumpy does not mean they are grumpy, maybe just maybe have you ever thought. " WOW, that just might be their natural facial expression." To end with, unless this technology is enhanced and backed up with science instead of opinion I do not think it will be very dependable in determing the emotional expressions of students.
