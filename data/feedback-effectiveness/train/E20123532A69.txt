Mr. Senator I think the presidents should be elected by populer vote.

Thats how it was back when our founding fathers first came to have there frist president and thats how it should be now. I mean if we're going to be judged be our peers shouldnt we be elected by them to. When it comes down to it who exactle is voting for us and can we control who we'er voting for and from the evedence shown in "What's wrong with the electoral college" no we can't. And no matter who are what we vote for all were doing is expressing a political preference it dosent matter at all to them what we want all they care about is what they want and what they think is best. When it my be best for them but not for the rest of us.

If we'er all going to have to live with who wins for the next four years shouldnt we all get a vote.
