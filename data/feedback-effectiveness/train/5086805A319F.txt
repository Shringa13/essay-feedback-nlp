Asking different people may lead to a better answer than just asking one person. Asking more people can help by getting then to say there opinion on the question your asking them so if you asked me what does 2+2 equal and i said 10 but if you asked another person the same question and they say it equals 4 you wold believe him because he is correct. You should also if you keep asking for people how to succeed youll get maybe a whole paragraph of advice but then that will help you if you keep viewing different perspectives of how people succeed in life.

Seeking multiple people for advice would make would be helpful sometimes but most of the time it is. Some good advice is that just keep on going or never stop trying because at the end there is going to be a reward and some of the bad one's would be stop trying you're never going to make it. You should as different people only f they gone trough and they have experience with it.

Another reason why you should ask multiple people for it is because some people maybe giving you the wrong advice so thats why it's helpful to ask other people that are similar to you because then they can give some some good advice that could be reliable to you. Reasons why you should ask more than person is because one persons advice could be like i was very passionate about my job and worked really hard to try to et it and i finally got the job and now the CEO of it. and the some bad one's is don't try to work because you can do what you love even tho you can do that but it can result of not a lot of money into your wallet but it sometimes will get you a lot of money and can afforrd what other people can afford.
