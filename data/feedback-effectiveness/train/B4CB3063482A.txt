What would you do if you saw what NASA saw on Mars in 1976? In 1976,

NASAs Viking 1 spacecraft was circling Mars, snapping photos of a possible landing site for its sister ship Viking 2, when it spotted the shadowy likeness of a human face. Eventully, scientists figured out that it was possibly just another Martian mesa.

A few days later NASA revealed the image for everyone to see. The caption said a huge rock formation . . . which resembles a human head . . . formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth. This said that the formation wasn't a human head but just a oddly shaped land form.

However, some people think that this could be an actule human life form on Mars, But, When Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time, they saw that it was just a natural land form.

The Face on Mars formed to be a natural land form, so scientists told the people that there was no alien life form and that they were safe from harm.
