A Facial Action Coding System is where it sees if you're happy, sad, surpised, anger, digust, and fear. How? It will tell by have a picture of a no emotional , than compare to your see what's the diifference.

Having Facial Action Coding System in the school, would be kinda great cause it would show the teachers what the student thinks about the assginment. Like, the Dr. Huang said ' Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor'. But, the computer needs to understand that most communication is nonverbal, like emotional communication.

But, than i'm against because how can the computer see what all the student are feeling like? Like, is going to look at every student face, if yes that had be a waste of time cause that would take the whole class period. If no, than do the teachers have to buy a Facial Action Coding System computer for every student.

Finally, I think it would be a good idea because the teachers would know how the students are feeling by something they had said or asign. If I was a student, I'd like it cause that would be a good new expreince.
