I think that students should be allowed to use there cell phones during lunch. Because it is there free time and there not in class. Cell phones shouldn't be allowed on in the classrooms, but lunch time. So I would have to agree with policy 1. You should allow students to bring there cell phones to school as long as there off in the classrooms.

Just in case there is an emergency after school while walking home or waiting for your parents to get them. Students should also be allowed to have them on after school even though it still on school grounds. You the principal or vice principal should allow cell phones on during lunch time, because the students are not bothering anybody it is there free time. So why take them away while there out at lunch?

We just maybe want to listen to music, play games, text, or call people on our cell phones. I honestly believe that it is really not fair that the teachers take away our cell phones while there out during free time or some other activity. Even if your at volleyball tryout's they should be allowed because you're not inside the classrooms disturbing other students your enjoying your own time. Others just want time of there own as they can during school hours, just get a break from all the homework or class work they have to do.

Just for 40 minutes (lunch) of our day we want to use our cellular device. Everyone should have a chance at least every other Friday to have there cell phones on during lunch time. If you the principal or vice principal agreed on this also probably more students would get better grades in English, Math, History, or Science if you allowed this opportunity to have cell phones out during lunch periods.
