I think the author supports the idea well because i would think it would be dangerous going to see venus , but that is just on what i read in this passasge. Some evidence that i saw in this passage of how Venus would be dangerous is that 97% of venus is covered in carbon dioxcide and it ca melt a submarine that goes in our deepest oceans. Also every other spacecraft that landed on Venus only survied a couple of hours.

My conclusion is that as much as us humans try to get up and personal with Venus it will never happend because of how dangerous it is.

An explantion of the evidence is that Venus is to risky for astroughnaughts to study it. Really the only I say this that Venuses surface is the hottest out of all the planets. Venuses surface tempature averages 800 degress Fahrenheit. Alson the atomspheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we are used to here on Earth.
