It may be true that some of us do abuse the fact that we are allowed cell phones at school. However, many of us respect our teachers and leave our phones turned off, only using them when permitted.

It would be a horrible and unfair thing to do for the school to take our phone privileges away. Many students may use them during class when they are supposed to be paying attention to their teachers, but not all students. Phones are a fun way to talk to our friends and family, even if they shouldn't be used during class.

Phones are also great for emergencies, whether it's to call your parents about a school bus running late or if it's calling the police for a wanted criminal taking you hostage at the school. For this reason, new school policies could just be effecting the safety of the students. Many of us love our phones and would hate for our rights to be completely taken away.

In addition, some students need their phones. Protective parents may require their children to call or text them during break time to let them know they're doing okay.

Cell phones are a great source for entertainment as well as a social device. Some people can put music or games on their phones to listen to or play during the day. Anti-social students may like using this during break time and lunch time to entertain themselves.

What harm would it do to allow students to use their phones during their lunch and break times? Class wouldn't be disrupted, teachers wouldn't be annoyed, and the students would still be able to have the phones that they enjoy using every day. By changing the phone policy, the school would be taking our rights away. This is also very unfair to those who use their phones outside of class. If we can't be trusted with phones only during our break times, then the school would be showing us great disrespect.
