Dear senatoris it posible for you to change the electoral college to election by popular vote for the president of the united states because its better."Acording to source one, the electoral college consists of 538 electors"."A majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the president". Thats alot of votes that electoral college needs.

In source two it says "over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now". More people prefer the direct vote because under the electoral college system voters vote for for a slate of electors,who in turn elect the president. acording to the article in reason one."In 2012 obama received 61.7 persent of the electoral vote compared to 51.3 percent of popular votes for him and Romeny. because almost all states award electoral college votes on a winner- takes-all basis".

for example in reaosn five "nixon in 1968 and clinton in 1992 both had only a 43 percent plurality of the popular votes,while winning a majority in the electoral college(301 and 370 electoral votes,respectively).alot of people say that electoral college method of selecting the president may turn off potential voters for a candident. people that are in presidental elections are people who want to express a political preference rather than people who think that a singel vote may decide an election.
