This history is about Venus. NASA is trying to go to the planet call Venus because is the planet that look just like Earth.

They want to go because they want to show how Venus look like. So people can go live in Venus, but NASA don't want to send people because is so danger.

In the solar system Venus is the second plane from the sun.

Venus is call the "Evening Star" because it is the brightest point of light in the night sky.

It is the twin planet of the Earth because it have the same side of the Earth, and in distance is the closed plane that Earth have.

"Each previous mission was unmanned, and good reason, since no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours.

Venus have 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets. On other planets the temperature average is about 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric is abuot 90 times greater than what we experience.

"Also Venus have the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solar system, even Mecury is closer to our sun.

Long time ago Venus was probably covered by ocean and could have supported varius forms of life, just like Earth.

NASA is trying to make mechanical computer the ones that help a lot in WW II, so they don't have to used people, but they have to use more tegnology.

In conclution that is a good idea because human need more space to live and some people like the idea to explor what is outside the Earth.

"Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation".
