Can we calculate our emotions like math? Even we don't use this kind of techonology we can tell other people emotions by looking at their face. If we known all about what other people think about us, it didn't good for all of us.

If we are happy, surprice, angry, disgust, fear and sad other people can seen by looking at our face. But some people can control their felling so sometime it hard to know their expression. Sometime it is good to know how people think about us but sometime not knowing what other pwople thik about us better. Some people can't tell other people emotion by looking at their face. Most human communication doesn't have emotion. They talked to each other because they think they have to.

Some people can know that the difference between a real smile and the forced smile. In real smile your muscles that begin at your cheek bones lift the coners of your mouth. In forced simle your muscles that begin at your cheek bones stretched sideways. If you are surprice you raises your eyebrows and if you are angry you tightens your lips.

School should not use this technology to the students because this technology is good but bad at the same time. Students didn't come to school happy everday. Sometime students come to school sometime they are not enought sleep so they don't want to study or they get angry easily. Some students have some teachers they didn't like so if the teachers know that their communication can't be good. Even if we don't use this technology most teachers can understand our expression by looking at our face.
