Do you belive in aliens?

The first reason why i say that the face was just natural landforms is because,there is no such things as aliens! For example the text says" a shadowy likeness of a human face." This example show that likeness isn't always certain you have to be absolutley sure before you start making claims about what the picture is showing. Did you see it for yourself? Did you do any research about it?

Another reason why the alien story is real is because ,no one officially approved it. They only took pictures of the face.

No one went down on mars to examine or observe the face. An example for this would be that the passage says" only this one had unusual shadws that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh". This example shows that if it looks like a Egyptian Pharaoh how would the aliens know about it?

The next reason why the alien myth isnt true is because in the passage it says the word"illusion" the word illusion means something that you can see but is not there. For example in the tex it states that " formed shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose and mouth". This example shows that an illusion may seem real but it is not real. You have to make sure that your facts are reliable and your resources are reliable.

Finally, why people say that the landfrom was formed by aliens is because it

" appered in books, magazines and radio talk shows--- even haunted grocery store for 25 years". They don't know just because this thing goes publice dosen't mean it is true. For example" Some people thimk that it is bona fide evidence". The people that think taht it is bona fide evidence did they do any research or did they just rely on what the social media says. In conclusion you should believe that the face is a natural landform is because aliens isn't real.
