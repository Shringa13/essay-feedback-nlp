You think technology can read emotional face expretion?

Yes I think because the new technology are very avanced, cameras have many fuctions and are very smart for take of pictures, the new cell phones have this technology one example is Iphone 7 or Galaxy 8 this smartphones have many technology, they know when are you sad or happy they have a special camera.

The news computers have many technology they are the best for this work because you can modify of system , you can put one camera and stard to work, you need create of program for analized of expretions and you can suporting with other student .

One need put of front to the camera and other need take picture and analized in computer, the next step is analized the facial expretions and see the muscles his face, eyes, cheeks or his smile the computer need analized the information and procces.

First student have a natural smile and computer detected this, he is happy, next student are crying, computer analized he is sad. but when student have pockarface the computer no detected nothing because no have any emotions, but what happen when one student make falce smile, but this is really good, I think of the computer detected he is happy.

I think of people need make manny technology because actual computers can be trick.
