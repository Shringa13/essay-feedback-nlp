Students Choices

I dont think that the principle should be able to make the students do an extracurricular activity that they dont want to do or like doing and if they dont want to they shouldnt have to maybe if they like doing student council, sports or working on the schools yearbook then they can.

One of the main reasons i say that students should be able to choose whether or not they do an extracurricular activity is because if the principle makes the student do an extracurricular activity that the student doesnt like and if there is some other students that actually want to do that activity what ever that might be it might be full of kids already so the kids that actually want to do that activity he or she cant do that now because the class might be full and there is a kid in there that doesnt even want to do the activitty he or she got put in.

Its just smarter in general because theres also the kids that will complain about anything and if u just let them choose what ever activity they want to be in they can thats if they even want to be in anything if not then they just dont do any sports, student council or working on the schools yearbook but i definetley dont think that the principle should be able to choose what u do in school just like u get to pick your classes most the time but if they are full then u get other choices.
