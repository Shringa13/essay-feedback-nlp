have you ever done at least one extracurricular activity at your school before ? i have never had a no expedients in doing a extracurricular activity before in my option i think my school should make students do extracurricular activity at school because maybe it will be a good way to have more movement in your body and learning new things to do not always sitting and copping down notes but its not always boring doing those things but maybe having extracurricular activity at my school could be a good thing for all the students so they could have something to do instead of shitting down doing nothing and just being lazy.

i support this division that the principal is making because students could learn how to make new friends students can learn how to talk to one an other and can learn how to do things as a team making new friends isnt always a bad thing to do when making a new friends they could show you new things that you have never done or speak laggugis you have never spoke or food you have never seen before thats why when you make new friends you might just learn new things, students should communicate with more people because it could take them to so may places when they learn how to communicate to other people in the world and not always to the same people like your friends it really import that students at a young age should learn how to talk to other people without being shy. and when communicating to people thats how to make new friends,, and team work is a good thing to do because it will teach you hoe to work as a team and not be alone it will teach you hoe to talk to one an other and also make you learn that you dont always have to do things alone also make new friends team work make people closer people they help each other when they need help on something and if you dont like to do team work things you should at least give it a chance because if you dont gibe things first chances how are you gonna know if you like it or not.

this would be good for the students because they could talk to more people they dont know and they can do more active activities and learn how to work together as a team .do you think that having extracurricular activity at your school is a bad thing to do?
