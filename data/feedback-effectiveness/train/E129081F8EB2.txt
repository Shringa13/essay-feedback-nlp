Dear Principal,

This letter is about the cell phone policy, the policy I would consider to use would be the policy number one.

The policy of number one is to use the cell phones during free times and lunch time but turn off cell phones during class time, I believe the policy is good making phone calls checking on others, talking to friends or family and texting to friends is good, but I would make a few changes to it the first thing I would change about it would be during class teachers or staff should check the phones to see if they are turned off.

The other thing I would change about is, teachers and staff should keep watch on their students if they are using their cell-phone in class because sometimes they cannot be trusted. I would still consider the policy of number one just make these few changes to it.
