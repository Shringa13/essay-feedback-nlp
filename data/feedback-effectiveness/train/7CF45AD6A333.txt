Traveling to Venus is a dangous task.

Even with the right equipment and gear the atmosher of Venus still might not be safe.

Scientists have been looking into going to Venus.

It has been proven that it is not safe to be on it or near the surface of the plant.

A group of scientist from NASA are looking into inhabiting Venus.

They are sending ships that nobody is on to collect data, but unfortulnlly that ships only lasted a few hours on the planet.

With scientists wanting to send people to Venus to collect data, is a little obsvered in the matter.

The atmospher is not safe even if they are not on the suface of the planet.

This might take years to compelte, but it will take to much of our time to explore and inhabit planets that we can handle.

If there are no more of the planets then we could go to Venus, but we should explore others first to see if they are more suitable for people to live on.
