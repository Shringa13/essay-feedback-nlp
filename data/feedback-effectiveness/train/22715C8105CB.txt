I agree with the author because it its one of our closest planet and it is most earth- like planet in our solar system. the autor says venus long ago was most likely covered largely with oceans and could of supported various forms of life. if we ceould visit venus we could probably find fossils from there.

NASA is making a silicon carbide that could last for up to three weeks in such conditions that meaans eventually we will be able to visit venus and learn about how the planet turned into gas and NASA is trying to make parts that would be more resistant to venus as it states in the passage." we are creating a system of mechanical parts tht could be more resistant to pressure, heat, and other forces."

in conclusion i do not the think the author wants to visit venus because it is way to hot to even try to land there if we did land there you would melt it says in paragraph 3 that the enviorment would crush a Submarine that is accustomed to dive in the deepest parts of our oceans. venus has erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequrnt lighting strikes to any thing trying to land on its surface.
