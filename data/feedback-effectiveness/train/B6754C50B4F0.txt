Dear, TEACHER_NAME

I think there should be changes because people like to stay in fit and some people that can't join sports do other things that are bad for them. Students think that we should stop wearing uniforms because they are not cool like other clothes. I think its a bad idea because if we stop wearing uniforms then people are to wear inappropriate clothes.

Students like me prefer more stuff like sports better food and other stuff but if we don't do good in school we don't deserve nothing like that. That's what I think but other people don't.

I think we should have more exciting sports and more stuff that girls can do like cheer leading a lot of girls like doing that to support our school when the kids in basketball when they have a game. I think cheer leading is awesome because we can do exciting moves and we can meet more people.

There is some other pretty cool sports like tennis, or kick ball, or baseball is cool to. When we have sports like that people stay out of trouble more. The sports that I like more is tennis because I like hitting stuff and i like to play with other people. People join basketball soccer more then the other sports.

This is the reasons why I think we should have more sports and more activities for us to play more and so we can help our school be better. I think there should be a cleaning group because if we do that then our school will be cleaner and it will help out the janitors more.

I think this is a awesome idea.

sincerely, STUDENT_NAME
