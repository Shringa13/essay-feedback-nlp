Dear Senator,

I believe that we should keep Electoral Colleges but massive changes to the system.  These changes would help prevent ties, avoid a large number of "swing" state, and also make elections easier.  For one to prevent ties, that is a hard thing to prevent cosidering we have no control over who someone votes for but it can be solved. If, in case of a tie, we due a tie braker as you will.  There will be a revotation process with 499 voters, these voters are picked at random in the city data base.  "...for example, Obama recieved 61.7 percent of the electoral vote compared to only 51.3 percent of the popular votes cast for him."

Number 2 is to solve swing states, again this is something it is hard to prevent but can be solved.  There needs to be an equal number over information distributed among the states and so forth.  For the conclusion of making elections easier, we need to make the more convenient. It takes a long time to vote for you and could be faster.  Although the electoral system is slightly flawed we still need to keep the "peoples" president, and there are not manyn other ways to do this than to due the system we have now.  The only major problem is the the system is out of date.
