Do you think that the FACE was created by aliens ? Well i think the face is just a land form but thats how i feel about it , I don't believe that aliens are real . On the other hand you might think they are real and i don't blame you because when i was little i thought they was real to ... by all of the movies i was watching about aliens taking over ect .

Although , few scientists believed the face was an alien artifact photographing . So they photographed the face as soon as they could get a good shot at it . On April 8, 2001 a cloudless summer day in cydonia Mars Global Surveyor drew close enough for a second look . When they had did they a pixel in the 2001 image spams 1.56 meters , they image was not a face anymore it was really Martain equivalent of a butte or masa . It reminds me of the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho," says Garvin. "

Finally, now you see that there were no aliens on mars and they aliens are not real . It was just the Martian equivalent of butte or mesa landforms . so now with all this information i just gave you, you should believe me now .
