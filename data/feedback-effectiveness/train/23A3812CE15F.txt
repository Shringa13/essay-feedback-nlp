Dear, Florida State Senator

Right now there are many disputes and arguments over wether or not to keep the electoral college. Personally where I stand, I think that the electoral college should have less power, but not be totally rid. Reason for my opinion is that alot of times the electoral college has too much say, and we the people dont have enough say. For example, Barack Obama recieved 61.7% of the electoral vote compered to 51.3% of the popular vote. The electoral college had the most say and impact upon the outcome of the election. Most of the time electoral college makes mistakes on who they pick.

Everything they say is based of an intellectuall standpoint. The pick shouldnt be based off of all intellectuall. That doesnt mean the electoral college is bad, if it werent for them I think we the people are too stupid to make the decisons just ourselves. we need intellectual. Most voters dont even know much about who they pick. We shouldnt be trusted with all of the say in the election. Thats why we need electoral college to balance it out and make it right in the end. Alls im saying is dont give them all the say in who wins the election just lower it a bit to be 50-50.

Sincerely,

We the people ;)
