Dear state senator i really think we should keep the electoral college. I mean look at how far we have come in are lives were we have kept this system working for years and it has not faild us yet. If we try to change IT now we will probally screw every thing up and it will probally be to confusing because of how the world is today.

If you look back at the probloms we had in the past we got passed them and came back stronger and improved we really just need new electors and just keep the system the same but get out with the old people and in with the new ones. "This method is a non democratic method also". this method also cant get any more fair because the people vote who they want and whoever has more votes then they win. whats not fair about that?

the electoral college avoids the problom of elections in which no canidate receives a majority of the votes cast. I really think we should keep this method so in the future we can always go back in history and talk about this method and the 23rd amendment.
