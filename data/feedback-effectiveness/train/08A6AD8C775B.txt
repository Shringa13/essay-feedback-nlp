If it were a real martian creation then you would be able to see possible life forms around it and it wouldn't be facing towards the sky, it would be like a statue, plus it would have been a really fantastic descovery and we would try to make contact with the martians and see how they live and survive on the planet so we could possibly live there one day. NASA would send space crafts and rovers to Mars so we could study the creatures. Finding out how to survive on mars and the other planets is important and is something humans should learn how to do just in case if something happens to earth and we aren't able to go back to it. But as you can see in the pictures it's just a messa, a natural cause in nature, something that happens on earth, but it just so happened to look so much like a face from the possible clouds and blurry picture from the first. Many people at NASA want wanted that to be a statue or something that a living creaturs has made, but as you see in the pictures it starts to look more like a natural cause of natural cause.
