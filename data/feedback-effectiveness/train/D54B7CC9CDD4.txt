The planet Venus, is called Earth's "twin" when in reality they are only the same size. Venus is a dangerous planet, our spacecrafts haven't been able to land in three decades. The author of this article gives us evidence that scientists are still trying to find a way to land on its surface. Why? They know it's a dangerous misson, they know somebody could get hurt.

Venus's thick atmosphere is made up of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide, which blankets the whole planet. The average temperature is about 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater that what we experience. Scientists should know that if they try and send a spacecraft full of men to Venus and land they are risking lives. Scientists want to study the planet on how it used to be, they belive it used to be just like Earth and it could've supported living things.

The surface of the planet has similar feautures that resemble our valleys, moutains and craters. NASA has one exciting idea for sending a spacecraft back but it would take time and money from the government. Don't get me wrong I don't like the idea of sending humans to Venus but it is survivable. It is possible, using solar power and creating a floating blimp-like vehicle. It shounds rediculous but we now how the technology and technology is still being built. The suthor belives it is possible and that if we try it could happen.

NASA would just have to be really prepared. They would have to study the planet and test the vehicle enough times to be sure. They would have to create an enviroment that is like Venus. The writer is right, it is worthy to study into and pursue. It would be a huge victory for use if something like this happened.
