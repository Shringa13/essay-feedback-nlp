Dear TEACHER_NAME,

Hello , my name is STUDENT_NAME. I am a student here at SCHOOL_NAME. I've heard that you were changing the school policy , and that you wanted to hear from the students. I would love for you to take the chance to read my letter . Thank You

As I stated before I've heard about the changes you want to make and I have a lot of suggestion on it . One of them is that may be after school programs is the only way some of the students stay out of trouble. So then with you taking that away from them, they will have nothing else to do . Then they will turn to the streets, and i know you wouldn't want that for our fellow students .

Also may be them getting a C grade average is the best they can do. Then our school wouldn't have the best after school activities we could have. Then the people who enjoy it the most , but doesn't meet the standard wouldn't have the ability to get a scholar ship in it even if they need it the most. Another reason is that, without after school activities students wouldn't really be able to work out. Then we would have even more students turning obesity.

I would really like to thank you for reading my letter and giving my suggestions a thought . I hope you really think about them. Also and try not to just take our activities for granted. Once again thank you.

Sincerely, STUDENT_NAME
