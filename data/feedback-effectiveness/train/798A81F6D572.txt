Community Service

By: STUDENT_NAME

I think that students should perform a community service because it would make our community stronger and bring us closer together in the things we do. Some things we could do are cleaning up liter and making our Earth healthier. Also we can throw our garbage away instead of throwing it in the streets or on the sidewalk and if we see a person do it, we could tell them to pick it up and throw it out or we can throw it out for them if they don't throw it away.

Another thing is our community can make a garden and plant vegetables, trees, flowers and other things. We can do that for helping families in need and we can actually help them too. Also, we could recycle our paper, cans, and cell phones or ink cartages. If everyone recycles, our Earth would be a lot cleaner and we wouldn't have to worry about having a dirty Earth.

Our community can also donate to homeless families and families that live in shelters and that would need things for their family or themselves. We can give them things like, clothes, toys, food, make up, blankets/sheets and other things a person would need. Everyone needs someone to take care of them and look out for them and they always will need someone there.

The community we live in could be a lot stronger and healthier if we all just try together. It takes a lot more than one person. It takes hundreds. If we just try it together, it'll work.
