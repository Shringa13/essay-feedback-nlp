Dear Principal

I Think its a great idea for us to start doing community service

Community service is an important thing because there's a lot of people that don't care about our world, and they would throw garbage on the street, but we can make things better by cleaning an picking up all litters.

This would also be good for some kids that only spend time on video games.

they could actually help and doing something for others, instead of doing what they like to do.

As the months past by we see that Our country is not the same, for these problems

For example, Littering, Robbing, Pollution, etc.

This could also be a punishment for kids. So if there were to have bad grades, You could tell them either you do better or do community service. The only thing that probably wouldn't be a good thing is if you made them do community service on weekends, That would just be unfair from my point of view, and im pretty sure parents would agree with me. Also There are also some community service that im sure people would apply to like Helping the elderly or spending time with them at nursery, And maybe taking care of pets without Owners. What else could I say, Like i said I think this is a good idea

I give you my 100%. On doing this and making our country better and the students helping out by doing community service.

My second Example On how Community service is good is by us older grades help out little elementary school kids. How does that help? It helps because if there stuck on a question or need help with there homework. The older grades can tutor them or explain to them

Well I hope You consider on taking this letter a help and Good luck to your decision
