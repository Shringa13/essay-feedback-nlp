Dear State Senetor,

T

he elecoral collage should stay the same because it worked this long right and it will keep working as long as everythis is fair. The country is based on our votes and that is how it should be because we are part of this country and we make it a free country. This is how our founding fathers stated this country and thats how it need to be our country has the best presedent that we could have in this type of situation because he is a colored man and there is nothing wrong with that. If we did not have an electoral collage it would be harded to keep things in line such as how the voting works and how it should be decided that we have the best presedent we can get at that time for our country. As an example we have been fighting on Iran and alfaganastan for a long time and presedent oboma did the best he could with the best that he had to make sure that we were still a free country and the we were safe from terrorism. The electoral collage was a good iead and still is so thst way we do always have a good presedent or for anything that this country need to vote on it always keeps thing in order and fair to this country so there for it is what this country need in order to make the best we can with the best we got.
