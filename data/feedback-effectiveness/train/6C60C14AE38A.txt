Does the Electoral College Work?

Mr. Senator,

I believe that the Electoral College should stay in process because it consists of 538 electors and the majority (270) that are the electoral votes that are required to elect a president. Elector  groups are picked by the runner; the groups help raise votes for the runners to get more word out on what the runner has to offer for our country. Plus, they make sure the elector running, has good legitiment reasons for becomeing our countries representor. With the presidential election held every four years, the Electorial College can be still processing men, and women, who are wanting to represent our country. Furthermore, the state elector running for president, is assisted by our votes, because when you vote for your candidates, you are actually voting for your candidate's electors. Once the presidential election is over, the staes governers start a "Certificate of Ascertainment" witch list all of the canidates who ran for president in your state along with the names of their respective electors.
