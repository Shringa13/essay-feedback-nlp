This article tells us the challenges that venus has to lay for us but this auther has found the was we try to beat tose challenges like in section 7 last sentenes he say that if we can just fine the resouses to build somthing to hold that force that venus has we could fined a lot that we dont even know. Auther did a very great job finding his resouces and fact about his story he told. He's a hard worker because of this topic this isnt a everyday topic people talk about I love how he talks about the trips at the end of the passages that we might be able to go the venus and look at what its like on that planet. To support what ive been talking about in section 8 line 1 he says Striving to meet the challenge presented by venus has value I beleave that if we challenge are selfs hard and hard that we could be about to make it there and by him saying venus has values i bleave that if we got there we could possible be about to see if they ever had ocean or animals or plants just like us we all know that the plantes are almost the same but just have some slite differenes. This article is good for people how like space and sciences to learn about venus and what we want to do as later missions it is possible that somthing once lived on venus thats probablly why we call it the twin to earth because it just like earth but just the first stages of earth.
