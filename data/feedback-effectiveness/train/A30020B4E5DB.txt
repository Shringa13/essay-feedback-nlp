Dear state senator,

Electoral Colleges are very important and should be in every "state". Electoral colleges are where electors go to meet up and vote for president and vice president. This is a great help because they are more educated in politics than the average citizen is. With the knowledge in politics they can be trusted to make a good decisionon who to vote for.

The Electoral College has five hundred thirty eight electors. Each state has an elector for each of the members in the House of Representatives. Not only does each candiddate running for president have their own group of electors, but you will get two of your own. The electors are very hard working also. They have to count all the votes made by congress. If the Electoral Colleges aren't in Florida then who else would want to count all of the electoral votes congress. No one has the time to do that unless it's in their job description.

Although an Electoral College can cost a lot of money to build they are still worth it. The bulding of the college will also be beneficial because it causes more jobas for the unemployed. Electoral Colleges are fundamental and will help improve the state's current voting system.

Sincerely, PROPER_NAME
