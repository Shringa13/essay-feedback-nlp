Most people know the dangers and risk of venus but why would anyone be detrermined to explore Earth's "twin". exploring this planet will allow more knowledge to the experts and allow to educate the society. Despite the dangers, we might get something good out of taking the dangerous risk.

Why would a scientis put people at risk for such a planet? The author is giving the idea that it might be possible for humans to study Venus. The author says " Venus would allow scientist to float above the fray." (paragraph 5) If you even had a chance to explore something different and be part of it, would you?

"NASA is working on other approaches to studying Venus"(paragraoh 7) NASA is coming up with different technology to be able to move farther to study Earth's "Twin". " electronics made of silicon carbride have been tested" this is one way they are trying to advacne technology to be able to study Venus. The scientist would taker such a risk to because NASA is inhancing their technology. NASA is even building " mechanical computers" which was important to World War 2 becasue of the calculations it made. If this computer made calculations for the war then it would probably have a lot of effect to the scientist on exploring Venus.

If you had the chance to ecxplore Venus and be apart of what's goign to happen would you? Even though Venus is a dangerous risk, people and experts would love to know the knowledge that the planet will give us. We also woudln't have as big as a risk if these technologies would work out. Maybe the scientsit aren't so wrong on this mission I mena they are experts. Scientit would love to the risk to expirence Venus, give information to others, and have our society grow more in education.
