being a seagoing cowboy is much more than an adventure it is also a lot of work. you will also find time to have fun,especially on return trips after the animals have been unloaded. The UNRRA hired us seagoing cowboy to take care of horses,young cows,and mules.

so far I have told you about all the good things about being a seagoing cowboy it is also dangerous.

On my second trip I was the night watchman my job was to report to the captian every hour to tell him how the animals were doing one rainy night I was making my hourly report

I slid down a slippery ladder and craked one of my ribs

That is only some of the resons to join us sea going cowboys.
