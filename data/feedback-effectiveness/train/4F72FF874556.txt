"The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational"(Source 2 paragraph 6).The first passage was about them in favor of doing the Electoral College. The second story was about them not in favor of them doing the Electoral College. The finnaly story was about not sure about it but they were more on the not having it side. I think that we should not have it beacause it's just to much.

To begin with, I think that we should not have a Electoral College because it's way to confusing. " Do voters sometimes get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong candidate?"(Source 2 paragraph 2)This quote means that the voters get confused sometimes when they are voting for a candidate. So if the people are voting for the wrong people then this whole thing is just a confusing mess.

Futhermore,I think that we should not have the Electoral College because it's unfair."The advocates of this position are correct in argung that the Electoral college method is not democratic in a modern sense... it is the electors who elect the preident, not the people"(Source 3 paragraph 1).This quote states that the people are not the one who chose the president it's the electors. So if the people are voting and the votes dont do nothing what the point of voting?

Finnaly,the last reason i think that we should not have that Electoral College is because it dont doing the people anything if we take it away."It can be agured that the Electoral College method of selecting the president may  turn off potential voters for a candidate who has no hope of carrying their state-Democrats in Texas, for example or Republicans."(Source 3 paragraph 9). This is saying that it may turn off potential voter but is all a good thing. It is not a good thing beacause most of the people that vote for a candidate are not ven getting pick.

Now you no why i take that we should not have a Electoral College. It is best to not have on because it way to much.
