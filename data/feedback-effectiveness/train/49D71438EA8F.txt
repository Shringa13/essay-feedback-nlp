The story of Making Mona Lisa Smile is about a Prof named Thomas Huang making a computer that can tell your emotions and the way you are feeling that day. You might not be the mood for anything and the computer can tell when your bored or not feeling anything it will modify the way it work so you will be in a better mood i think its great. Beacuse kids might not fall asleep in class as much if thcomputer sees it and will fix it and it will help whats wrong with people. Part of me say its a bad idea becuase most people dont like talking about their emotions so that will make things worse if a computer does it and feel their emotions . Its pretty cool through how it can read your face and all 44 major muscles on your face. I would say no to it becuase i myself and like telling my emotions about things and dont a computer telling me about them
