dear TEACHER_NAME

I think we should be able to have cell phones in our school due to the fact that you can see that most 14 or 15 year olds have cell phones and other electronics and so that we wont have to sneak them in anyway, I mean come on this school gives out psps and ipods and other stuff to us so its like there daring us to bring them to school.

It is the 21st century new things are coming out all the time every one has a cell phone or ipod or something you would think that we would be able to take our electronics to school by now, also don't you see all that violence out there. IT is always the same thing all the time some crazy person goes to a somewhere and starts shooting up the place like columbine, Virginia tech, and more recently Arizona some one just started shooting the school right now we wouldn't be able to call the cops for help and then you would have yet another tragedy at your hands.

we should be allowed to carry cell phones to school for practical reasons and if the unexpected was to happen.
