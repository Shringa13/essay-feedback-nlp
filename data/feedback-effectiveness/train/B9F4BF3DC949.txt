Lukes point of vew is that Luke is trying to get people to partisapatein the seagoing cowboys program. it would be a good thing because people get to see the sea. And geting to be able to see the sea is a one in a life time chance because you may not be able to get anouther chance to go in the sea on a boat. anouther thing that would be cool to see is the world war ll just got over and you could see the boats and all the debre that the world war left behind.

Some people may get scared because they are in the middel of the sea and they lile to be with there famielys at night so the familys can keep them safe.

some people might think that when you are in the middel of the sea you are risking your life and you should not risk your life to go at sea.

The trip is much more than just any adernarry trip the trip will open up the world to you or any person that might go on this wonder full trip to go see what the sea looks like.

Anouther thinn is that all the money that you spend to go on the trip goes to the people that need the money the most will reseve the money.
