Dear state senator, as time moves on things needs to change. The way we vote for our president is unfair, outdatede, and irrational.

It is time we change things and move to a election by popular vote.

The electoral college was founded many years ago by The Founding Fathers. It was a compromise between the election of our President. It selected electors thats would put the vote in after we voted. It was a great idea back then... I think it is time we change this and let the people vote. We cann't use the same ways as time moves on. This should be an election for the people.

In the electoral voters don't even vote for the president. They vote for than elector. This could very well be anyone holding public office. People sometimes get confused and vote for the wrong candiddate. Back in 1960 louisiana nearly succeeded in replacing all demoratic electors with ones that oppose John F. Kennedy. Somestimes faithless electors have refused to vote for their party. This is outrageous! What is this happens again. With the time and place we are at now these things should not be happening.

Futhermore, the people should elect who becomes OUR president. We are the that have to live with this president. Another reason is because its unfair to voters, the winner-takes-all system shows that caue candidates don't spend time in states they know wont will. And if the electoral college gets a tie it would be horrifying. Leaving it up to the House of Representatives.

All of this is to show that electoral college should be Abolished. This is outdated, unfair, and irrational use. Putting our faith in people we don't know has caused problems.
