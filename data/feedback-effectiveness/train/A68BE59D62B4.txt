How would you feel if we had a technlology to read students?

face

I feel like that technology can't tell if you happy, sad, anger, or disgusted by anything because you can just make any face in it can just say what it is i mean i'm not saying that technology not smart now days, i know that technology can do all type of things i feel like we don't need them type of thing in the classroom. I feel like people don't want to show they feelings a lot of people want keep things to they self.

We all want keep a lot of thing to are self the face scan reading people emotional not right but if people something deep i feel like you should share because you can't hide a lot in things in life i feel like it the sametime we should and shouldn't have this face scaning emotional.

I feel like people think it good to have for them self i feel like we should get it because a lot of human perform this impressive "calclulation" everyday because you can probably tell how friend is feeling simply by look on her face. But to be on the safe side we can tell how people are doing because some people be lying about how they feel.

Would you every use technology to read students emotional?

Yes so i can tell how they are doing and if the feeling well or bad today i feel like students should show they feeling because we would know how i person feel intel they tell us.
