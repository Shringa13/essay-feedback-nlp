The author support's the idea by saying ," Each previous mission was unmanned , and for good reason , since no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours .

Another thing that the author is also talking about is another project , looking back to an old technology called mechanical computers . These devicers were fisrt envisioned in the 1800s and plaed an important role in the 1940s during world war II .

I Venus at thirty - plus miles above the surface , tempetures would still be toasty at around 170 degrees Fahrenheit , but the air pressure would be close to that of sea level on the earth . solar power would be plentiful , and radiation would not exeed Earth levels . Not easy conditions , but survivable for humans .
