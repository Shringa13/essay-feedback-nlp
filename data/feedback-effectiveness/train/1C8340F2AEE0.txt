Have you ever wondered what other planets are like? Have you ever gotten the questioned yourself about these other planets like... Have scientists found other lifeforms? Have scientists found resorces on other planets like they have on Earth? well then if thats the case let me explain you why "Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents." There could possibily be other life forms on other planets and even Venus, how there's life forms on Earth, typicaily Humans, Animals and even Bacteria like Algy and Fungi, In the article "The Challenge of Exploring Venus" In paragraph 4 it says "Venus could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth." Another reason why Venus is worth studying is, like the Sun its the hottest thing in our solar system, what if Venus is not as hot as the Sun but what if Venus is hot for anything to be on there, in the article " The Challenge of Exploring Venus" In paragraph 3 it says "Venus tempreture average is over 800 degrees Fahrenheit.", or what if it relates to Earth in many ways? In the article in paragraph 4 it says "Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans" This is all the evidence on why Venus is worth discovering dispite the dangers while, Scientists may have discovered a bit of Venus and a bit of Mars unfortionatly for now some of those planets remain a mystery while some are on the very peak of changing from the unknown to the discoverable.
