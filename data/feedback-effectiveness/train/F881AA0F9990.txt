It is an innovative idea from may people to cut down on the use of a motor vehicle. in these passages it gives pros on the better enviormental way of living.

The first source talks about a city that is in Germany called Vauban, where residents have accepted the challenge of no car usage. The city is designed for walking to department stores, grocery stores, ect. But this so what utopia is not all a utopia itself, where 30 percent of families own cars. Also the United States Enviornmental Proctection Agency is promoting "car reduced" communities like Vauban. This action to have a car reduced communites was because of the damage done by cars on the enviornment by pollution.

The second and third source is about how a city took matter into their own hands and had a "car free day". In the cities of Paris and Columbia is where it took place. First the reasons why is because of near-record pollution of poulltion in the enviornment of Paris. Where on Columbia the reason for the car frre day was because they want to promote alternative transportation and smog. In Coulmbia this day has been going on three years straight!

In the last source, it tells about how car culture is ending slowly. In the United States pople have been "buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by." A study shows that driving by young people has decreased by 23 percent from 2001 and 2009.
