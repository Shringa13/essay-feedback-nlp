My first paragraph is , I think that some schools offer distance learning, for students because if they dont want to attend to school in the morning ; for example they can take that classes online, the classes that they miss the day they are out of the school . Students would be benefit from being able to attend classes from home, because if they are in High School and if they are in 12 grade , and they need some classes to pass they can take online that classes . Because if they dont pass that classes they are going to lose the year in High School , and all the students they are not going to graduated.

My second paragraph is , what I think is if schools offer classes online and/or video conferencing , to the students that means that they really want to help students when they dont attent to school. For instance ; that schools are really good they need to help all students that they need some help , if they offer that classes online is because they want all the students to work hard every single day at home or anywhere, they wanted to work on those classes online , and if you take classes online you can take notes to help you when you have to take a quiz about what you read and what you know.

If students deside to go school , they can take all the classes that they want to take . They can take in the school were they went but; if they don't want to take classes online its does't matter what they want to do if they work from home by the way online , they can work in the school if they want or at home if they wanted to work really hard without any reason and if you get good grades on that classes and you understand everything you can pass that classes.

That school's give us a oportunity to work on classes online , if we want to work with other's classes that we don't have yet . For example , if you at home don't have any internet , what you can do is if you want classes online you can go to the library and work on those classes there , you are not going to pay nothing if you work on that classes , they give you free that classes that's why the school's give you that option to you and for all the student's if you are a smart student and you study really hard , you can finish that clases in less than a moth but if you study hard every day at home or at school that can help you.
