Dear principal,

I just heard that you are trying to decide on a very big topic. I thought i would wright you a letter to let you know what I think. I fell that you should require every student to do some sort of community service. There are two simple reasons why I think that you should require community service. My first reason is that it teaches the kids good live lessons, and the second reason is that will make other schools maybe try it to.

Community service can teach life lessons. Some kids look at community service as a bad thing. When you think of community service most people would think of picking up trash. Say a student hated picking up trash but for community service made him pick up trash. He would learn form this to mot litter because there are people that go around and pick up trash and now he know what it is like. Another example is say a student helping out at a nursing-home. this student could of not like to be around old people. now he would be able to see that the elders are not that bad.

My second and last reason is that maybe other schools will see what we are doing and they would try it. Can you just think of another school likening the idea you had of making kids do community service. You could inspire other schools to help make their community's a better place.

I hope you take the time to read this letter and her what i have to say.

From your student
