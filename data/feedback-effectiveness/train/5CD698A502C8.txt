Dear Principal,

It would be best to require students to perform community service. They shouldn't think community service is just a waste of time because its not. There is litter everywhere in this town and we need people to pick the litter up.

For example, litter can become a health problem or can affect the environment. if there is too much litter it could be disaster. the environment can be affected the most from litter it can kill plants which mean no oxygen and can kill animals which means no food. people health can also be in jeopardy. if there is too much litter the air can become polluted and people would become ill.

Another example is, nobody would want to live in a polluted place with litter everywhere.

its disgusting and dirty. people can die from litter and there health can be destroyed. Community service is not a waste of time because your helping the environment and hundreds of people life.

My conclusion is, community service is not a waste of time. Your helping the environment and people's health. Help pick up litter and stop littering before it to late.
