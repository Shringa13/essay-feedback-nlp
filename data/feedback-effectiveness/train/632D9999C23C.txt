Dear, state senetor

I think that we should change to election by popular vote for the president of the United States of America because it makes more sence to change to the election of most popular votes because lets say people vote for one president more than the other president but the president that got less votes gets picked because he/she has more electoral votes than the other.it says on paragraph three in source one that"The electoral college process consists of 538 electors.A majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the president". This states that the president can get more electoral votes than the other and still get to be the president. i disagree with that i think it is not fare for the president who gets more qualified citizen votes. The citizens are the ones who need/want the presidnt why not give the citizens what they want and what they all vote for? You should give what the citizens want because hey are the ones who are voting for the new president or the same president one more time.it says in paragraph 10 source 2 "under the electoral college system,voters vote not for the president,but for a state electors.who in turn elect the president".

sinceraly,
