Venus will be a great planet to live on. Imagine if you could have a house on earth and one on Venus. There are alot of bad things about Venus. Also there is alot of good things about it to.

Some of those not so good facts from the passage will be no space craft survies the landing on venus for more than a few hours. It has a thickness atmosphere of almost a 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Verus.

Some more not so good facts about venus will be some of the clouds have highly corrosire sulfurie acid. Also on that planet surface temp is over 800 degrees ferhight. Then the atomspheric pressure is 90 times greater then what we experrence on our own planet. This may scare you away but dont let it do that. People is coming out with new things everday. It just takes time.

Venus was probably coverd with large oceans and could have supported varrious forms of life just like earth. Venus still has some features that are similer to earth. Temperatures would still be very warm at 170 degrees fahrenneit, but the air pressure would be close to that of sea level on Earth. Radiation would not exceed Earth levels but survivable for humans. Old techtology called mechanical computers were first envisoned in the 1800 and played in 1940s during world war 2. It make calculations by using gears and levers and dont require electronic at all. Which on venus it will be some time intell electronic will be there. All in all, give it some time do some research study and some day we will be on venus.
