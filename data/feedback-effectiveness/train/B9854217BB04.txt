When I was reading this article, it brought to my attention that Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers.

It says that " venus is sometimes right around the corner in space terms humans have sent numerous spacecraft to land on this cloud draped world. I think the author supports the idea because, he talks about how he got so many reasons why the mission was successful or not, this also has a reputation.

This was very previous when i decided to support this idea.

Although, this author is very intelligent and experienced alot of things, i will support him in many reasons because The National Aeronautics and Space Adminstration has one part compelling idea for sending humans to study venus, he thinks its so good that now he telling people to check it out. If he had gave up on this support that he had, Venus would avoid the unfriendly ground conditions by staying uo and out of their way.

I agree with him on alot of things that hes done that's why i support him, he tries to provide healthier weapons and materials that would be safe to use. When he intervented this it says that many researchers are working on innovations that would allow our machines to last long enough to distribute the forceful interaction to our capability of the since of Venus. I support him because he makes it recognizable to see his point of view on this.

It must be scary to live up in Venus or mars.
