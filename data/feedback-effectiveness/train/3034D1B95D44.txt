The reson you should join this organization is because it has so many opportunitys that open up for you and your family. For example you would get to meet new people everyday you would get to see new things all the time.

Especially if you don't like working long hours at work because if you are Seagoing Cowboy you only have to work a couple hours a day.

You should especially join if you like to see ancient artifacts such as an old castle is Crete and even the Panama Canal.

The down sides of being a Seagoing Cowboy is that you will have to travel far from home and stay away from your family for long periods of time and you wouldn't get to see them much.

Those are some resons that you should join the organization because like I said it would be such an opportunity for you and your family. Make sure you join if you would like to see cool things, meet unique people, and just have fun, but if you don't like staying away from home you shouldn't join because you will have to stay for long periods of time.

There are also some reasons that you would not want to join. Just remember all of these things could change your life for ever.
