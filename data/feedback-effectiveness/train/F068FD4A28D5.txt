Phones, Cars

Should people have the privilege and/or the right to be able to have their phone out inside the car? While there are some good reasons why you should have the right, there are some things that people just can't help.

We already can't stop all the people that use their phones while they drive and now a days more and more people are getting addicted to their phones almost making it impossible to put down even while just having a simple dinner let alone putting it down while there driving most people don't even realize that there even doing it and most care now a days have the Bluetooth or people sell Bluetooth devices so you can be on call and drive while you drive making it better for the people but as tested on "MythBusters" changes a little but still distracts you in some sort of way people also know there way around things already and sometimes work or no most of the times it works but some of the times it doesn't under a code of law because there are not enough laws in places or "fine print" and they can just say oh well it's like a Bluetooth but it wasn't type of stuff and the court can't do anything about it.

This is what I think about the phones calls and driving is may not be clear cause there really is no answer to this question for me personally I don't care what they do or say all I care about is if our people our safe there really is no reason for people to be not allowed to have there phones in a car or make calls or answer them maybe there should a cam in every car that shows whenever your texting and driving or have your phone up against your ear just so if the other person that gets hit they have the cam to see if there were texting or on a call whenever you are driving and get into accident (hopefully no) but still you would have the prove that they were on it meaning the phone or not.

They (cops) think they can just lie as well but with that cam they can't lie, or anything even know they shouldn't even if it's an exsaturration it still means something in the court of law it could either mean good or bad for the person testifying what they did or didn't do and with that cam there is no more lying anymore and takes away more problems like for example who/what happened before the crash how many people were really in the car and finally how they got hit and out of the car if camera is in correct placement in every car sadly they all have to be in different placement in each variety of car.

This is what I think and what people should do about cars and phones the true ones would understand this message thank you so much for taking your time to read till again bye.
