Dear principle,

In my opinion i think that all students shouldn't have to participate in community service, because some kids have important things that they have to do, not want to do, have to do. For example what if a student had siblings that were younger than they were and couldn't take care of themselves, so their older siblings would have to take care of them. Then the student couldn't take care of their community service hours. Another is what if a student participated in sports and had an important game to go to. That means that they couldn't finish their hours as well. Another example is what if students had a big test to study for and it was worth half of their grade, then they would have to study instead of community service. That also means that another student could not fulfil their community service hours. It's not just three or six students that could not fulfil their hours. The whole class would have to study for the test and more that six students have younger siblings that they have to take care of and finally, more that six students participate in sports or other extra curricular activities which means that all of those students could not perform their given community service hours. Since they could not perform their given hours then they would have to face the consequences even though it wasn't the students faults. They had more important things they had to do, not want to do, had to do.

If they did something bad to get in school suspension or out of school suspension then they should have to perform community service but not without and independent reason. That is my position on whether or not the students of the school district should have to perform community service or not.
