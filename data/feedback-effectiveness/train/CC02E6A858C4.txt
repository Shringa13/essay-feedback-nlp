Thomas Haung made a new technology called the Facial Action Coding System. The process begins when the computer constructs a 3-D computer model for the face. All 44 major muscels in the model must move like human muscels.

I think this system should be added in schools because during school teachers will know how their students are feeling. In the passage it states that a teacher points out that this system can recognize when a student is confused or bored.

This system is really useful in my opinion, because you can recognize all emotions someone is feeling. You can recognize by looking at them but only 1 or 2. with this new system you can find them all.

Another reason why this system is a good idea is because even if the person is trying to hide their emotions you can still find it. This new sytem is a great idea/invention. this needs to be known. mor people need to know about this amazing idea.

All in all, i think this is a great system and they should add it to schools. It will help teachers and students. You will recognize every emotion the student feels. It can help lots of people. What do you think?
