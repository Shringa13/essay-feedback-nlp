Some schools require students to complete projects over summer break to assure that students are still learning while on break. Many of these schools and their students have mixed opinions on if these projects should be teacher designed projects or student designed projects. I believe that these projects should be designed by teachers to ensure that students are staying on school related topics, [NEED 2 MORE REASONS]

The first reason why I believe that teachers should be the ones designing summer time projects are so that these projects for students can stay related to school related topics to fully ensure that students are still learning while on summer break. For projects with the intentions to keep students learning while on summer break the first issue would be students making projects on subjects that have no relevance to school, this would be very inefficient in the efforts made by school boards to keep students learning.
