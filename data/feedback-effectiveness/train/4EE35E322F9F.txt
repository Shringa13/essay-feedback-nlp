Why you should go to programs

I think people should participate in Luk's progam because in the text it says, "Luke also found time to have fun and the fun they had was baseball and volleyball". Luke has a lot of things to do because it says, He was working two part jobs in a grocery store and a bank his friend Don Reist invited him to go ona Europe on a cattle boat. So you can tell they go on alot of adventures all the time because in the text it says, "It took about two weeks to cross the Atlantic ocean from the eastern coast of the United States annd a month to get to China". Luke and Don are always prepared to go to places because it says, "Katie's farm a boy came to Luke to prepare him for the for hrd work not the dangers at sea and his job was to watch the animals every hour". Luke got to see new things because in the text it says, "It opened the world to him i'm grateful for the opportunity he says, It made me more aware of people of other countries".

Luke had to watch alot of animals because in the text it says, "UNRRA hired seagoing cowboys to take care of the horses, young cows, and mules that were shipped overseas". The captain he slid down a slippery ladder on his backside Luke's heart bursted like 300mph. As he vrrrrooommmeeeddd a opening on the side of the ship a long strip of metal stopped his slide from falling into a dark Atlantic. On his ship they have so much fun activities I know this because in the text it says, "That they have table tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing reading and whittling". Luke said that the day in pacific war ended they got there seaman's paper's and boarded the SS Charles W. Wooster headed for greece.

And this is why I think you should go to the program I hope you like it
