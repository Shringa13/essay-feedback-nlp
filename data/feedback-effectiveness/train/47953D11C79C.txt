Dangers Taking The Risk

In The Challenge of Exploring Venus , the author suggests that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents because its the ''Evening Star '' and its similar to earth and often referred to as it's twin.

Even though venous is dangerous its a mystrious planet to look out for and its the second planet to the sun.''Atronomers are fascinated by venus because it may well may once have been the most earth like planet in our soloar system''.'' long ago venus probably was covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life just like earth''. Till these day venus still has some features that are analogous to those on earth. The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familar features such as valleys mountains and craters. Venus can be our nearest optio for a planetary visit. Whats the value of returning to Venus if the mission can be both safe and scientifically productive?

Although NASA has thought of sending humans to study venus to see how the conditions are up there . However the conditions are not easy but its survivable for humans. Its the risk to take because venus its fastnacting to discover and see what life is up there? Can humans surive yes or no life changing experence.

In conclusion of the challenge of exploring venus it has value ''not because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself but also human curiosity will likey lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors.'' The travels on earth and beyond should take no limits by dangers and doubts but should meet and risk to the ends of earth imagination and innovation.
