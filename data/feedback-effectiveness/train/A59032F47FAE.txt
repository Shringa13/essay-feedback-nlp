The technology and cars has made the developers to invest on cars. The cars have all change time by having something in common . The cars that have been used for this technology is made by google. Google its a company that has internet wireless and its a huge company that only makes technology better. The car that has been desing has many manifactures going on . When they build a the workers they all have their positions and if i would be able to work in this car my position would be the antolock brakes. The antilock brakes prevents the driver to fall out of there is an actsident. Also in the article says that having unshape cars its bad or even if there is something weird of something new they think is bad. My conclusion is that if you think that havind an unshaped car is bad or even if it looks weird dont think that its a bad car because technology its changing our daily lifes and how we see the un expected about it.
