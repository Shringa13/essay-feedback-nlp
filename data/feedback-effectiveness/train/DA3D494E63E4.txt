NASA is over reacting over this face on mars because they think aleins did it, they been taking alot of photos, and they been showing it to the public. NASA should stop this because it could be just a natural landform.

NASA thinks aliens made the face because it looks like a face. Studys show that it could be a natural landform like a butte or a mesa just like we have on planet Earth. NASA argues that aliens could be hiding their markings behind a haze. Critics argue that it could be a natural landform. NASA took a photo of the face and it appeared to look like a butte or mesa.

NASA should stop taking photos of the face because they already have enough pictures of the face to look at. In 1976 the took a photo of the face by using Viking 1. Nasa argues that they can get better views when take new photos. critics argue that you dont need that much of photos to figure out what the face is. In 2001 they used the Viking to take a photo of the face and they got back a good photo. It showed that it was a natural landform and it looked like a butte or a mesa.

NASA should stop showing it to the public because they know what the face is, and people dont need to worry about it. The face starred in a Hollywood film, and appeared in books. NASA argues that they need to get the information out to people. Critics argue that people dont need to worry about it and get freaked out about it. The face was on talk shows, checkout lines for 25 years, and in magazines. This shows that the face was out in the public for people to see.

In conclusion NASA is over reacting over this face on mars because they think aliens did it, they been taking alot of photos, and they been showing it to the public. I think NASA should stop taking photos and reasearching the face because its a butte or a mesa.
