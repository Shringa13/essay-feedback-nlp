Unmasking the Face on Mars

Well on my opinion I don't think the face is a natural landform, in the text it states- twenty five years ago something funny happened around Mars. If the face has been apart of Mars for ONLY twenty five years I don't think is was apart of martian life, it would've already been discovered a long time ago. I honestly think it has been made up by an illusion.

Stated in paragraph three, NASA uveiled the image for all to see, it was a huge rock formation, which resmebled an humans head making out the shaped of nose, eyes, and mouth. They thought reasoning this situation of Mars would be a great way to grab the public's attention to Mars. It did.

Ever since then it has became an pop icon, so now that i think about it, It does'nt seem like it was apart of martian life. They so far haven't even caught real martian life on planet Mars. So I don't even know how to think that NASA could determine it was apart of alien life on Mars. It possibly could be but I don't think anything could live on the surface of that COLD planet.

It puzzles me that it just randomly popped up out of nowhere and has been located at that very spot for twenty five years, why could this happen now? I don't know maybe later in discovery the scientists of NASA will find out what and why this happened. NASA's budget wished there was an ancient civilization on Mars. I guess we'll have to find out later in the future.

How could they possibly determine it's real? Let's make a couple guesses.

The "Face on Mars" has been starred in a Hollywood film, appeared in books, articles, magazines, radio talk shows, and even haunted grocery store checkout lines! Now you know why people are so amazed of being able to read about this story and give NASA so much feedbacks about this "Face on Mars" story. One day they'll determine what'll happen.
