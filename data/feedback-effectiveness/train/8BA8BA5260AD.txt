The Facial Coding Systemis a system that can tell your emotions by caculating the way you look and by one little look it could tell it all how your feeling it tells whether your mad, sad, depressed, happy, even mixed emotions.

I think the use of the Facial Action Coding System is a well needed thing for schools because it could tell your teacher whats going on whether you need help or not or if your going through something and need to talk to someone. The Facial Action Coding System would be a great thing to have in school because some kids are shy an dont like to talk and raise there hands in class infront of everyone and if you dont ask questions when you dont understand something that could cause you to fail the class all because of your shyness.

Yes , the Facial Action Coding System is needed for schools and worth spending some money on for schools all over the world but them again we wouldnt need to invest in this if students spoke up about what they needed and whats going on but some students jus have a sad or mad face everyday for no reason so the Facial Action Coding Syestem may read their facial expressionand say that student is mad , when the student is just doing there normal face . The school board or government shoudnt have to invest in the Facial Action Coding System if teachers take the time and talk to their students some teachers are the reason the students become mad beause they make the students mad when they have to do too much homework or even class work , it also is a better way for humans to connect with the computers as it says that in paragraph 1.

To sum it all up this technology could come in handy in certain situations , the teachers might like it but the students might not , your boss may like it but you probably wouldnt . Its a win win situation for students it would tell others how your feeling and if you sad someone might talk to you to let you know your not alone , and for teachers its benificial because it could help you understand your students more.
