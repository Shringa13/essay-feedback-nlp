Wyat Gibson, former scientist from NASA, 1976. Today, spacecraft one has captured a image to what looks to appear as a face. Scientist figured it was just another Martain mesa. "Only this one photo had unusaul shadows that made it look like an Egyptain Pharoh." I predicted that it must have a degree of surpise among mission controllers back at the Jet Propulsion lab when the face appeared on the monitiors.

Some other scientist belived the face was an alien artfact. I snapped a picture ten times sharper than the oraginal Viking photos. I have done lots of reaserch, and revealed a natural landform. I reasched the photo a lot more. After a lot of rearch, I decoved that there was no alien monument after all.

We decieded that we still did not have enough evedience. Perhaps, alien markings were hidden by haze. Still there is no evedience as we continued. After more and more reasch. There is still no alien monument.

We decovered that the picture is acually the Martian of a butte or mesa. They are landforms common around the American West. It's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about that same height as the face on mars. In the end, there was not evedience of alien lifeform or artcraft. What we predicted might not be right, but it's defenitly not a sign of alien life.
