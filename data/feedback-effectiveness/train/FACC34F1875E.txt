Five cities have been reported to have had a day to where they banned cars. They call these days, "Car Free Days". Vauban, Germany; Paris, France; Bogota, Colombia; Cali Colombia; and Valledupar Colombia. This day ended with positive results.

For starters, the residents in Vaulban, Germany have given up their cars. Street parking, driveways and home garages are generally forbudden in this experimental new district on the outskirts of Freiburg. Vauban's streets are completely "car free"--except the main thoroughfare. Car ownership is allowed, but there are only two places to park--large garages at the edge of the development, where a car-owner buys a space, for forty thousand dollars, along with a home. As a result, seventy percent of Vauban's families do not own cars, and fifty seven percent sold their cars just to move here. In the passage, "In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars", Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and a mother of two, she quotes," When I had a car, I was always tense. I'm much happier this way."

Additionally, Cars are the linchpin of suburbs, where middle-class families from Chicago to Shanghai ten to makeÂ  their homes. Experts say that that is a huge impediment to current efforts to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emmissions from tailpipes. Passenger cars are responsible for twelve percent of the greenhouse gas emissions in Europe, and up to fifty percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States.

Futhermore, after days of near-record pollution, Paris, France enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city. "Paris bans driving due to smog" by Robert Duffer, states that congestion was down sixty percent in the capital of France, after just five days of intensifying smog.

So, in summation, there are some advantages of limiting car usage. By limiting car usage, you're also limiting pollution, carbon emissions, greenhouse gas emissions, etc.
