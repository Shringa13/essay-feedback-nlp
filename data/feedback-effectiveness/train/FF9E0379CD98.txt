Some school offer distence learning as a option for students to attend classes from home by way of line or video conferencing.

I think is not benefit for student, that take classes online because in the video maybeabilities ,and dont have a teacher is not organized dont have partner when are you take the classes online.

Teacher: when are you take the video online you dont have a teacher for tell you what do you need do in the class ,and him cant help in your work for example the teacher cant help with kahoot or quizlet or with others strategies of work .

Organized: when you take the class online you dont have organized, if you need highlights or pensil for write something for read it or explain your work.

Partners: in the class you dont have partners or others people with you, just are with your teacher online, but is not your confidence or your friend like in the school the many people is your frends However; the people can say you cant take the class online because you work for ten hours for this you need to take the class online, but is not bad idea take the class, but you cant work or cant study after school with partner.

Conclusion: you dont are prepared for take the class online worst is a video coferencing because you dont have teacher, organized ,and partners in the end you cant take the class because is more difficult for learn in your work. is more better take the class in the school you have more benefit how you can pass the class and more oportunities that the school have for you ,and in the school you can help new students ,and in the school you can protrude like better student in the school. Also there are alternative of take class online becuase ther are benefit.
