Although in theory a student-designed project sound good, in practice the students will most likely struggle to make the project because of lack of understanding the project. This is why a teacher-designed project would be beneficial because it would be more thought out, leave a clear outline of what to do in the project and have more structure then say a student designed project.

When you're a teenager you want to be free as possible but sometimes you are too free, that you don't know what to do with this much freedom so you do nothing.

In this sense the project that would be designed by a student most student would have no idea where to start discouraging them for even commencing the project and of course there will be people that can do the project easily but we want to make the project fair and equal for everybody.

This is why a teacher-designed project would be best because it would leave a outline of what the project is about, What you will create, how you will do it and what criteria you have to meet to have your project pass leaving it fair and equal for everybody or another solution to this problem is that it could be the students choice if he/she want to design the project or take the teacher-design project

In conclusion a teacher-designed project would be the best option for this summer project because it would let the teacher outline certain thing they want in the project to ensure that the students are still learning over the summer break.
