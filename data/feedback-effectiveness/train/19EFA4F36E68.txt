I think there should be a little changes like they need more meetings to choose there president and the vice president how many votes are in to choose there president. they need about 538 electors and a majority of 270 electoral votes for our president. The electors equals the number of memebers in congressional delegation. Columbia is allocated 3 electors and treated like a state for pureposes of the elctoral college. any of our candidates run for our president. It runs how they act and how they are with the people that they have. The presidential election are every four years. The winner takes all and be's the new president. Our governer talk to us like a big long speech. They do a recoding of the new president. The electoral college, they're not alone; according to a Gallup poll in 2000, taken shortly after every thing. Over 60 percent of voters would perfer a direct election. This year voters can expect another close election.  Voters vote not just for there president, but for a slate of electors. The people would have to vote for a slate of 34 Democratic electors. The american people are lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the biggest ellection. The voting takes place in the House of Representative and that are we vote for the president.
