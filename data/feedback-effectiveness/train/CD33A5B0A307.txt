Dear state senator, i have sent you this letter to tell you that we should not abolish the Electoral College, the Electoral College has many benefits when voting for president. The Electoral College is widely regarded as an anchorism, a non-democratic method of selecting a president. In 2012 the election for president, Obama recieved 61.7 percent of the electoral vote compared to Romneys 51.3. Because most states award electoral votes on a winner-take-all basis, the slightest plurality in a state can cause a landslide electoral-vote victory in that state. Though a tie is possible because the total number of votes is 538, it is very unlikely.

The Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal. No state has enough electoral votes to elect a president. The voters in toss-up states are more likely to be the thoughtful voters. A large state will recieve more attention from presidential candidates in a campaign than a small state does. The Electoral College avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast.
