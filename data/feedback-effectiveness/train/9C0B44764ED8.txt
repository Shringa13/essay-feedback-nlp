The Facial Action Coding System could be valuable in classrooms because it could make a sudent's work more easy for them to do because it could tell if the student is having a hard time on the work or just does not like the work they were givein like it says in the article.

Another thing it could be valuable for is how a students is feeling lso like if the system see's that a student is feeling unhappy the system could tell the teacher or another student that this student is not in a good mood and that they might need some to go chcek on them.

So those are the resion's why I think the Facial Action Coding System would be valuble in classroom's is that it could tell if a student is having a hard time doing the work or just does not like the work they are doing and another thing is that it could help the teacher or other stundet's know that one of the stundet's is unhappy and that they might need someone help like they are haveing a bad day or they are feeling sick. And so thats why I think the Facial Action Coding System could be valuable for.
