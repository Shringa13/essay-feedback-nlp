Dear TEACHER_NAME:

Community Service is a very important aspect of life.

As a firm believer in this, I would ask you to consider that all students of SCHOOL_NAME take part in community service.

As Christians, we are called to administer to the needs of the poor, but if this school is not pushing for it than how are we fulfilling our duties as Christians?

Whether it's working in soup kitchens downtown or helping babysit a neighbor, we should be striving to answer our call from God.

I have done community service with my peers and during my experiences, I have encountered many people from various ages, genders, races, and social classes.

From every trip I have gained a valuable experience.

During one of my experiences, I was working in a soup kitchen in downtown Cleveland.

Although intimidating at first, I helped by serving those who didn't have the same gifts I am blessed with.

Isn't that what we are called to do?

Serve others like Jesus did?

I learned from this that every human person is valuable and should be treated with dignity and respect.

Wouldn't you like all of the students at SCHOOL_NAME to participate in such a great journey of faith and attempt to carry out what we are taught by Jesus Christ?

I believe by helping our society to become a better place is why we are put here on this earth, but we shouldn't be wasting our time and talents by selfishly keeping our gifts to ourself.

We are called to share those gifts with others.

Simply, I am asking that you implement at least ten hours of community service for the entire school year.

That is only a little over an hour of community service per month.

By doing this, we will come closer to God and to those around us.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
