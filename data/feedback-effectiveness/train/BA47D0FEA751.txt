The development of a human contolled car is not the reason for the cars not being far more advanced, but the safety of the drivers and passengers. The cars would make everyday life more simple and less stressful, but the cars would have to be more and more carfully programed and very well tested, to ensure they don't cause harm to the driver and its self. If everybody drove in an driverless car there would be less recks and seafer conditions; but it would be very expensive.

The materials and costs would sky rocket, gas companies and bio-fuel makers would be very unhappy becasue they would lose there jobs. The roads would also be very risky to work with. traffic jams and heavy pedestrian activity would have to be very important; The sensors would have to be top of the line and have a very sensitive trigger for response.

In recent years the cars have been more and more technologically advanced. Radar and mapping have become much more adapt and are being updated much more frequently.

There are many conserns people may have, but the cars have come a very long way and are becoming even more capable each day. They may not be the best idea right now but in the next decade or so will be obsolute .
