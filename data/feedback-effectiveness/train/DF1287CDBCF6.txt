Using technology to read students' facial expressions isn't the best thing to do. It could help the teachers show who understands, who doesn't understand, and who does and does't pay attention. This could help the teacher in many different ways.

Using this to help the teacher is alright. It could also become a distraction for the students. The teacher uses it to determine if the lesson that they are giving is hard for the students to understand or if they are doing really well with it. If the students realize that their facial expressions are being recorded or used for something, they could make so many faces into it. It would be a nice thing to do, but the students may not be very mature with it.

With this kind of technology, it could help the teacher plan their lesson so the students can understand, but they don't get bored. Interacting with students help them learn better, so if there are some confused, or not into the lesson, it shows that and can help get them to understand and get into the lesson.

Teachers would have to think if this is really worth having, or is it going to do nothing for them. Teachers want students to know how and what they are doing, but they need to learn how the students, know what to do and how to do it.
