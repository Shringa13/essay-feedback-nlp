You know what i do agree on what this article is saying why because people tend to use their cars all the time and yea what if we live far from town ok thats fine but i see people in my naighborhood driving two streets down just to hang out with there friends when one could simply just i mean put it this way if we were to drive less we would limit accidents , tickets, and polution so come with me as i explain my ideas.

You might ask your self how would this limit accidents well say you were driving one night to your best friend jeffs house and jeff lives three streets but you wanted to get there faster and the car on the oppisite lane the driver falls asleep and all of a sudden boom!! you dont know what just happen think about you could of been dead right in that instant but if you would of walked no accident you could of dodged the car.

Tickets and people might say " man, police be racist pulling me over for know reason and now i have to pay a fine and go to court" no buddy you were pulled over because you were being stupid on the road trying to act cool in front of your friend but see maybe if you where riding a bike or walking you probaly would of never got pulled over and  wouldnt have to pay a fine.

Less polution polution is really bad in alot of countries i mean its so bad that its kind of hard to breathe i mean it would suck if yoy were on vacation in the carrabians trying to enjoy a nice tropical day outside but you can't why because you can bearly breathe with all that polluted air around so yea.

I mean its not hard to ride a bike or to get a electric scooter or a moped or walk it benefits you and our earth i mean i agree with driving just to places you need to go like traval or grocrey shopping not to race act dumb or black smoke people i we made a don't drive your car week it would really benefit our earth alot.
