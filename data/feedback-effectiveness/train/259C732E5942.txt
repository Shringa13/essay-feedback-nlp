Extracurricular activities are good for everyone. For example you might want to go into acting or sports. You might just want to try something new. You might think that something is boring but then you end up liking it. Just like how I never thought I would like basketball but I tried out for the team. Turns out I do like basketball and I think I'm pretty good at it.

Have you ever wanted to try something new but don't know where to start? Well, join a club. You get to meet new people and you get to try something new. If you think you like something else better you can always join that club. You might even be surprised by how much you like it.

I have sometimes thought that I would never play basketball. My parents always thought softball was my sport. Until I saw my brother playing basketball and thought that it looked fun. So, I played on an AAU basketball team. It was so much fun to play and to meet new friends. So, I quit softball and now I play basketball. But, I still have friends from my softball team.

Now, say you a new student at a new school. Like anyone else you would like to make new friends. So, why don't you join a club? Everyone in that club likes the same interests as you. You would make friends right away. Even if you quit everyone in that club will still be your friend. You can move to a different club and make friends there.

So, yes I do agree that students must participate in an extracurricular activity. They get to try something new. They could try something that they think the don't like but then actually do. They can make new friends. So I think it is a good choice for students to take extracurricular activities.
