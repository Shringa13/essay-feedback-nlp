Dear, Florida State Sentor

I'm writing you this note to express my opinian wether or not to keep the Electoral College or to get rid of the Electoral College. My opinian has to go with no i'm not in favor of keeping the Electoral College due to the fact that it's unfair to a candidate that wins the popular vote but loss the election because the other candidate gained control of a state like texas with 34 electoral votes. Most people clear want this candidate better than the other but the candidate with the popular vote wouldn't win because the other candidnate would get states with more electoral votes. Another problem i want to adress is that sometimes the electors get confused on who to vote for i know if i had all that pressure on my i think i would get confused also from the pressure. The Electoral College can also turn off potential voters due to the fact that they hvae no hope of carrying their state. In other words people think they don't have a voice in the election because their vote really doesn't matter the vote that really matters is the Eletroral vote. Due to this reason less and less people vote these days. About i half of eligible voters voted in 2012's election as you can see there is a drop in voters. Most voters these days are people who want to expreess a political preference instead of people who think a single vote may decide who will win the election. Also Sentor im not the only one that wanted to gte rid of the Electoral College. Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and the AFL-CIO all wanted to get rid of the Electoral College.

Sincerly,

P.S.

Sentor i hope you make the right choice.
