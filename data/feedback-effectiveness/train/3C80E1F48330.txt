Unmasking The Face

A lot of people lately have been suspicous of my company NASA. While I don't agree with them, I do see their side. The general public has all reasons to be suspicious torwards the "Face of Mars!" Sounds like something from "The Twilight Zone." Well, Mars, though so barren, might has well be considered the earth's twin sister... or brother. The two planet's sufaces have shown some interesting simularities, like water remnants and climates. Not to mention volcanoes. This is where we find the reason behind the face of Mars!

On our planet earth, we have land structures called "Mesas." These elevated lands are found in the "American West", where the surrounding deserts (used to be oceans in theory), are now filled with canyons, rock flats, salt flats, mesas, and other forms only found there. Mars might as well have a northwest region where one could find earthlike simularities. This may as well be the reason behind the face. Also, one should note that the shadows may be rocks making a shadow from the sunlight. Another logical explanation to look at France. Shaped like a boot, it is just a land form that naturally occured, looking like something we know.

My company would also like to state that this really "isn't" a cover-up. In true fact, the discovery of other life or remnants of one such time would be positive to us, and to our projects. So, say what you want. Believe in what you think, but we at NASA belive this isn't alien. Just another simularity between Mars and Earth.
