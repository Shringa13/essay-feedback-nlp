The Untied states of america have some of the most interesting history in the world from their food,people to the govrnment. They have a system of govrnment called a representative democery in this system they elect people to represent your groups need and want,but the thing that makes them intereseting isn't the way they run their country it is the way that they elect their representatives.

They use what is called The electoral college to elect their leader this system has it's problems, for an example the people aren't voting for who will be their leader other wise know as the president,but for the people who will vote for the president. Even though this system has it's down side it also helps them in a lot of ways. this stops you form having a popular vote meaning more then just two parties can send their rep.

Do you know the saying if it is not broken don't fix it well the Electoral college is that system america has use this system for so long and they aren't the type of people for change that fast, farther more the Electoral college is only used for the president compare the two system by looking at their other branchs their all doing pretty bad right now. Thats why if it ain't broke don't fix it.
