In the article "Making Mona Lisa Smile" technology is used to read the emotional expressions of people called the Facial Action Coding System, I think that it is a very useful thing because with this you have so many advantages like being able to tell if a student likes a lesson or is bored with it.

When using Facial Action Coding System their are many good reasons to use it for example paragraph 6 says "if you smile when a web ad appears on your screen, a similiar ad might follow. But if you frown, the next add will be different. also classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored, and could modify the lesson for the student. FACS works by whatching 44 major muscles in your face to see how they move to determine your expression.

Although this is a great tool to use when trying to teach students it is probably very expensive to have it installed into computers for students nationwide. Also some poeple may not like the fact that they are a computer is able to read their emotions and may reject this tool. For some students it may not even help them and would rather talk to a teacher for help rather than use a computer.

Even though there are some down sides to using Facial Action Coding System it is still a very good tool to use in the classroom or anywhere needed. FACS can classify six basic emotions happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness just by seeing the the movements of your facial muscles.

I think that using this tool is a great way to improve several things and by looking at my examples I have shown that using technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is a very valuable tool.
