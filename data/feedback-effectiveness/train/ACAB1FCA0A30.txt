I would like to change the election for the president of the United States. I would like to vote for president myself and not for a slate of electors because then I can't really control who the electors vote for. Electors in the past have refused to vote for their party's candidate and I would be very mad if that happened to me. Voters feel like their votes don't count. The Electoral College, to voters, is unfair.

I don't like that representatives from each state, represent a number of voters that make a huge difference such as numbers from the hundred-thousands to the millions. Thats the only good reason about the Electoral College, when voter numbers from each state have a huge difference apart and the electors cast their own vote, but when voter numbers don't have a huge difference apart, I don't like what the elector

The number of electoral votes given to each state is bad because there can be a lot of the same numbers and an example is, Texas has 38 votes and North Dakota, South Dakota, and Montana all of 3 votes. Each party has to have trusted electors because too me, if each party has trusted electors, then maybe a lot of the votes won't be the same. If the votes between the two candidates, are a tie, the voters still can't vote for them, themselves. Voters in toss-up should mainly be able to decide the election because they usually really listen to the competing candidates so they are usually the most thoughtful. Votes in big states aren't fair to smaller states because presidential candidates give alot of attention to big states than to small states.

The Electoral College, can sometimes give voters no hope to the candidate they want to win because electors could vote for the other candidate. An example is, Republicans in a state might eventually know that their vote will have no effect so they end up paying less attention the the competing presidential candidates. I think that thats a reason how plurality happens and voters think its unfair.
