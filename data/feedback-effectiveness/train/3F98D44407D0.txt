There is a new software the has been developed that improves accuracy in perceiving the emotions of other. The Facial Action Coding System. They put a imagine of Mona Lisa Smile. In the applications called FACS knows how she is like how happy you are or angry. But with her they got a 83 percent happy, 9 percent disguested, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry. In the software is the latest innovation from prof. There is Thomas Huang, of the beckman institute for Advanced Science at the University of illinois, working in collaboration with prof. Also they actually calculate emotions like math homework and how a computer recognize the subtle facial movements we humans use to express , and how we feel. The computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the faces. And the facil expressions for each emotion are universal, observes Dr. Huang. Even though individuals often show varying degrees of expression like not smiling as broadly. With Mona Lisa demonstration is really intended to bring a smile to your face, while it shows just how much the computer can do. They are 3 things while you are looking in the mirror 1 is raise your lips at the comers of your mouth, 2 is squinting yours eyes slightly, to produce wrinkling at the comers of your eyes and 3 is holding that raise the outer parts of your cheeks up. Towars your eyes. The facial feedback theory of emotion, moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions, but also may even help produce them. Empathy feeling someone else's emotional state may happen because we unconsciously imitate another person's facial expressions. All that is about science or technology. I think the application is smart because it show's you how you are in the moment.
