I entered a program before called the seagoing cowboys how it all started though was because of my friend don reist. I was working two part time jobs at a grocery store and a bank and when my friend invited me to go to Europe on a cattle boat.

I got to travel a lot to. So here is why I am asking you to join the program just like I did.

I know you probaby won't do it but I am just going to try my best to convince you so the first reason is since the (UNRRA hired seagoing cowboys to take care of the horses,youngcows,and mules that were shipped overseas.) That means you would get to help out other countries and their disasters. Another reason you should join is because you get to travel all kinds of places in the world ( Besides helping people, I had the side benefit of seeing Europe and China. But seeing the acroplis in Greece was special". he says)which he is actually me. One more reason why is because (luke/I also found time to have fun on board,especially on return trips after the animals had been unloaded. The cowboys played baseball and volleyball games in the empty hold where animals had been housed. Table-tennis tournaments,fencing,boxing,reading,whittling, and games also helped pass time.)

So there are 3 reasons that I wrote out of why you should be a seagoing cowboy and if your a girl I suppose you could be a seagoing cowgirl. Now I am not forcing you to but just convincing you and I hope that convinced you because all of it is really true. So if you don't want to that's fine but if you do Great I didn't write all of that for nothing!
