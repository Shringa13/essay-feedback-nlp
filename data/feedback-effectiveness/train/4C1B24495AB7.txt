Its not a alien its just how the landform was growing It started growing in a weired way and it kept going. Its just a landform there are many landforms on mars but this one is a little different from the rest of the landform this one looks more like like a face and the rest are just plane landforms. But if there was aliens On mare why would they just make one landform that looks like a face if there was aliens on mars im sure they wouldnt just make one that looks like a face and dont make anymore. They would make more and more till they got tired of making them..But its a landform growing in a shape of a face if there was different landforms that grew the same way it would be the same way as this landform. Or there coud have bind so bad weather and it could have did this and made the face.
