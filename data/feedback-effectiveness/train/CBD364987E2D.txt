Dear Principal,

I believe that cell phones should be allowed in school around free time and at lunch periods. I think that the kids at schools would be a lot happier with more freedom. I also, think that with more freedom would become more responsibility, and i think that the students in the school could handle having their cell phones out during passing time and also during lunch periods. Many people would like to have that freedom of having our cell phones out. Also, i think that if we were able to have our cell phones and do things with them then we would be a lot happier and things would be a lot better at Warren Woods Middle

School. I think that in classes cell phones could be used a lot with different assignments. Such as we could be texting a teacher our answers or looking things up. Also, you could play the quiet game and then just have our phones and then we could be texting each other back and forth about question and other sorts of things. I think that if we were allowed to have cell phones in school then we would only be able to have them outside of the class room and if had them any where else then we would have to get them taken away and also, then maybe cell phones would be band from schools. I think that the principal should be able to trust us to have our cell phones.
