It was me and my other scientist friends in the lab discussing the ''The Face on Mars'' I told them it was just a enormous rock that was two miles long that's all we usullaly see things like this and they kept responding it does have a mouth, head, and eyes so what should we think. All the scientist now believes that the face is an alien artifact but it is not and here is why.

In May 24,2001 twenty five years ago when it happen. Our sister ship took a picture of a shadowy likeness of a human face. There's not an actual human face on the planet Mars then I told them there are two keywords likeness and shadowy. Then my friend Ben said a few days later NASA unveiled the image , but then I quote it was a huge rock formation which rembles a human head formed by shadows giving illusion of human parts.

Then in April 5 1998, when Mars Global Surveyour flew overv Cydonia for the first time and there people took ten times better images and said it was just a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all. Then my friend Ben started to understand until his friend Jeff said April,1998, a cloudy time of year on the Red Planet . The camera on board MGS had to peer through wispy, white clouds to see the face. They say they were alien markings were hidden by haze.

Finally I told him that it was just a big old rock with shadows covering it. And other scientist say it is just another enormous rock.
