Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I think that students of SCHOOL_NAME should be aloud to use their cell phones during lunch and other free times, just as long as the phones are turned off during class.

I strongly agree with this subject. Teens in our school are getting in trouble almost everyday because they are getting their phones taken away from them in lunch and breaks in between classes. Then there are some students who don't really get what "No phones in class" means.

I think that you should make it so we can have our phones out during lunch and between classes, because sometimes it maybe an emergency and we need to call our parents about something that we don't want to talk about in the office phone were everyone can hear what your saying around you. Therefore if you have a cell phone you can go call your parents some were quite, were know one can hear what your saying.

This just might help you to. I am almost sure that schools have to pay a phone bill, am i right? well by letting teens use their phones you can decrease the bill, or even better get rid of all the extra phones. Then if you need to get a hold of someone in another room you have the PA speakers.

I hope you take this even more serious than i do, i feel that it is a privacy purpose to students at SCHOOL_NAME.

My personal experience with office ladies listening to my conversation is very bad, i can hear them talking about what i was talking about to my sister in the office. Well some of the things that i said where personal, not only to me but to my sister.

I hope you at least think about this subject and consider letting students use their phones at lunch and in between breaks we have after classes.

Thank You
