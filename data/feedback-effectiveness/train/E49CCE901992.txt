I wouldnt use this Facial Action Coding System on students because it those enables computers to dentify humans emotions but not real ones, it just shows the human emmotions byt the expression but not the real emotion that the human is feelin, Mona Lisa's natural face might be like that but not because the Facial Action Coding System identified that she has several different emotions showing in that paint from Da Vinci means that she was for real feeling those emotions, I think that is just how her face is , because all the people in this planet have dufferent faces that we cant not even describe if they feeling this or that because there face is just like that, But sometimes its true the Facial Action Coding System might be true because Dr. Huang observed that Da Vinci has studied anatomy to help them paint facial muscles precisely enough to convey specific emotions.

Dr. Huang predicts that it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor.

I t says that the same technology can make computer animated faces more exoressive.

I believe that the Facial Action Coding System works perfectly good and does indentify humans expression like Dr. Haung said but not real emotion becasue the person can just be expressing some emotions but that doesn't mean they feeeling it that way.
