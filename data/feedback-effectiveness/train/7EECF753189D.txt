Have you ever seen an alien? In 1976 the camera weren't as good as today so it could be anything. But today the cameras are great quality.

Back then you would have thought that it was an alien but today we clearly saw that it was just a landscape and not an alien. Its like the man it the moon it is just a landscape it is nothing big at all. By saying that it is an alien people today would probally believe that it is true they would go crazy.

But we found evindence that the first Viking was wrong and the it is just a moutain. Now a days we have new high-resolution images and 3D altimetry ,but back then they didn't have that kind of technology. Technology today can take ten times better pictures then back in 1976.

As the world grows faster in technolog we can expect better and better pictures but we found evindence that on Mars there is no life forms. So as far as we know their are no such thing as aliens. On Mars there might be pictures or thing that looklike an alien but its not it a fairytale our mind thinks it saw one but you never did. As i was saying there is no lifeform on mars,

Technology has delvoped over the years. From when the first sight of a camera to now it will always evolve into something better. Technoogy is the only thing will always change into something different.
