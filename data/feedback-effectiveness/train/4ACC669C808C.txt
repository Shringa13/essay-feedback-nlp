Did you know earth had a twin? Venus is earths twin but they are not idencitlea twins they are quit the diffrent. Venus is an extraorandraiy planet the atmosphere is almost all carbon dioxide so we would not be able to breath. Its avrage tempchure is 800 degrees fahrenheit so yeah be sure to bring your swim suit for a tan but wait theres more with the rain you will feel amazing and just melt away because all the rain is acid. Now reschers want to explore Venus because they think long ago venus was just like earth. It has mauntian ranges and vallys. "Long ago, venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life just like earth today. We cant get on Venus because we dont have tech or metals that can stand the harsh enviroment of Venus. Of course we have little info because we can orbet around venus safely but this can only give us so much info. You would think oh wjy dont you just take picuters. Well you know all that acid rain i told you about well there are thick clouds around Venus all the time. You migh think we are at a dead end on trying to explore Venus but if you think that you are right. NASA needs to be able to form new techonagly before we can do anything else on Venus. That is a challenge NASA has accetpiced is to keep trying for Venus.
