In my personal opinion, I think that it would be very valuable because when your having trouble on a problem and you need help but your teacher is busy doing something or you are on your own, it can modify the work down for you. I get frustrated all of the time with my work and I don't alway have a teacher right there with me to ask how to do something or to help me every time i'm stuck on a problem. I think it would be great and super convient, especially for the kids who need a little extra help on their assignments. This essay also goes to show how technology is taking over the world, sooner or later there will be no going to school, it will all be over computers from home. I think that this could really help some kids out but what if you get a text message and you start smiling about that and it thinks you are doing great so it doesn't modify it for you? I feel as if even though this could have some really great benefits to it, it could also have some really bad ones.
