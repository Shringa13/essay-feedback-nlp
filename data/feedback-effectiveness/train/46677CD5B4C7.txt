Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I think it would be a bad idea if the school district and your self would allow everyone to bring there cell phones to school , even if there turned off during class. I don't think its okay because its during lunch time and free periods, students should be socializing at that time. I also don't think that it will teach students to be more responsible for there stuff.

I do not agree because some students are mean and curl. They just don't care! They will take other people stuff, and sometimes if they don't like that person they will brake there things just to seem cool. When they are not!

When all that happens the first thing they will do is run to the administration or to the principals. Then parents will get involved. It will just cause to much problems, when students should just be focused on learning and getting a good education cause that's what school is for its to be someone successful in life.

So TEACHER_NAME

I don't think you should allow students to bring there phones to school. There would be to many problems, and our school doesn't need that. Students just need to get a good education. Come on isn't that what schools for? For all students to be successful in life ?
