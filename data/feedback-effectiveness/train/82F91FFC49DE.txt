Drivers shouldn't be able to use devices while driving. It causes them to lose concentration. If they lose concentration they could end up running a red light, not stopping at a stop sign, or even a wreck. They could also run off the run or into something. If they were to use a phone it's if they are at a complete start and not driving. If they get a call just put it on speaker or tell them to hold while you driving.

They should text while driving either its more dangerous than being on the phone. If they text while driving their eyes will be completely off the road and they won't know who's in front of them. Texting and driving is what most people get arrested for. People should get all their texting and calls out the way before driving in traffic. Texting and driving can cause an accident quicker than being on the phone.
