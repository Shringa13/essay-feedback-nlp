If my principal had decided that

ALL

students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity for example students could participate in sports, work on the year book, or serve on the student council. I would strongly disagree because there is people like me that dont want to do sports and would just rather go straight home after along day of school or some could not physically do sports or stuff like that and lastly i think i will just make students mad so you will have a lot of students yelling and talking back and not doing what they are supposed to do.

I don't think you should be forced to play a sport or something like that because if you want to do it you will do it so there is no need to be force by principal. After school people just want to go home school is long enough so having an after school activity will just make some people upset and because I will be mad if i get forced to participate in an activity that will take time out of my day, and besides people have stuff to do also after school, some people dont have time for that.

Some students have disabilities so some of them won't be able to do that stuff and they have to go straight home after school. i'm just saying if the principal does that there will be a lot of complaints for example why do they have to do it and we have stuff to do this is not fare. If all the students will be forced to do something like that they will all be tired the next day because some people are just not used to it like me for example.

I dont think it is wrong sports are very good for you for example sports are good exercise and you could try something new, and you could even learn that you like a sport, but if some one wants to do an activity or play sports they can do it on there own they dont have to be forced for that stuff if you want to do it you will do it if you dont you shouldn't be forced that just going to make the students mad and aggressive. That should be something you supposed to do on your own.
