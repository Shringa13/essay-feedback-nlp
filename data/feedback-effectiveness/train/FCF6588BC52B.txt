Imagine being able to detect exactly how other people are feeling, even when they are trying to hide their emotions. Well there is this New software that has been developed that can detect how others are feeling better than humans can.

I believe that the value of using technology to read students' emotional expression is important and it should be used. Since this technology records facial expressions, the same technology can make computer-animated faces more expressive- for video games or video surgery. Another reason is "Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication." Another purpose we can use this for is as a lie detector, because in the begining of the article it said that Mona Lisa is 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry. So if somebody is lying i'm pretty sure they would be scared to be caught.

Imagine how much video games will improve with this technology, and medical help too. Also think about all the criminals that will get caught because the new technology will prove that they were lying. As you can see these are the reasons why I think we should use this new kind of technology.
