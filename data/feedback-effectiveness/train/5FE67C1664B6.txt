I know and believe the

"face on Mars"

is just a natrual landform. I don't find it possible that this landform could be evidence for any life on Mars. Even if it was why would there be a head without a body to be found? Also, why would NASA hide something like this, this would be considered a good discovery? All these things are reasons why I believe that ''face on mars'' is a natrual landform.

"Face on Mars could'nt of possibly been evidence of life on mars because, why would there be a face but no body to go along with it. Also, If NASA had dicovered something as amazing as life on Mars they would be happy to let the world know. The only reason to believe there is life on Mars is the natraul landform other than that there is no reason to believe. In conclusion, I do not believe that the ''face on Mars'' is proof of life. I also feel that the natrual landform is the only reason people believe that it is.
