Today we will talking about The challenge of Exploring Venus, what's is venus, where is ubicate venus and why is important talk or learn about this subject or who discovered this mean.

Venus is a planet in our solar system and is the second planet from our sun and occasionally the closest in distance too Earth, Venus, and Mars , in this palnet the scientist can't explore this planet because is so far away from the Heart , and this have some differences, for example; one of these is the speed mean that sometimes we are closer too mars and other times to Venus.

Venus maybe this issue explains why or not a single spaceship has touched down on Venus in more than three decades, scientist said that the atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus, also this planet has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solar system, Venusian geology and weather present additional impediments like erupting volcanoes, powerul earthquakes, and frequent lightning strikes to probes seeking to land on its surface.

We know that Venus is a planet in our solar system but that we really don't know and scientist wants to know is know about if in that planet probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, human wants to conquer some of those planets to live in the future, that's the reason why the scientist are discussing about that, or if the rich peolpe can build some skyscraper or some building for rich people go to travel in Venus.

NASA is working to know more about Venus, another example is if the electricity can works there, or how we can get it,

Venus from a ship orbiting or hovering safely far above the planet can provide only limited insight on ground conditions because most forms of light cannot penetrate the dense atmosphere, more importantly, researchers cannot take samples of rock, gas, or anything else, from a distance. Therefore, scientist seeking to conduct a thorough mission to understand Venus would need to get up close and personal despite the risks.

Striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has values, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors.

We talked about Venus, we know now that human wants no only have more information they want explore and live there, also they want or we wants to know wha't there or if there exist life, but we don't know if Venus got inhabitants is not our planet and we need to leave it, but if we are capable to conquer, our next planet to live in the future would be Mars or also Venus.
