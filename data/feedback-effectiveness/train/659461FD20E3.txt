Dear senator i was wondering what the electoral college was. And iv noticed that its unfair .Because of the winner-take-all system,the posablet of a tie. of couser there are more reasons but those are the top two.

Many american people think the electoral college is unfair Because of the winner-takes-all system. Which is when candates dont spend time in state they know there not going to win. For example in the 2000 campaign seventeen states didnt get to see who they where even voting for. And some of the largest media markets didnt see a campaign ad. Ever one should at least get to see who mit be running the U.S.A. If the president was picked on most poppler vote the people would see who there voting for and also see what there are plans are for the U.S.

Another big reason the electoral college should be changed is because of the posablet of a tie. Many people are worried about this because the responablaite of chocing the president would be the house of represantives. Which is unfair because each state has only one vote. For example let say florida represenates 400,000 people, they would have as much to say to texas who represenates 1 millon people. But if the president was chocien by polpular vote then there could never be a tie and voter would have a changes to vote for who they really want.

All and all the electrol college should be changed. Because of the winner takes all system and the posablet of tie. The college has worked for a long time now but i think the american people are ready for a change.
