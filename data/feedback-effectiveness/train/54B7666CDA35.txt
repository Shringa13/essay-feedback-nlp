Hello my name is luke and im am in the Seagoing cowboys program. My friend Don Reist invited me to go to Europe on a cattle boat. I work two part time jobs in a grocery store. It was 1945, World War 2 ended in Europe, and many countries were left in ruins.

This was and opportunity for me to be drafted in the military service.

I couldn't tell my friend no. So I went with him. The cattle-trip were an unbelieveable opportunity for a small -town boy.

Also, 44 nations joined together to form UNRRA(the United Relief and Rehabilitation). I had the side benefit of seeing

Europe and China. Seeing the Acropolis in Greece.

It took about to weeks to cross the Atlantic Ocean from the eastern coast of the united states and a month to get to china.

I was busy caring for the animals during the crossing. My job was to check on the animals every hour. I also found time to have fun on board. We played baseball and volleyball .

In conclusion, i learned that after i graduated high-school life got harder, but i cant let that get in my head. I will face lifes challenges and will overcome them. The trip wasn't about what did, it's about what you learded and its about the adventeur.
