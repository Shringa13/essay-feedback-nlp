Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I think we should have a club in doing community service. Some of the students think it is a wonderful idea and some think it's a waste of there time. I think we should have a club in doing so for many reasons. The first reason is because if we don't take care of our community then it will be a mess and no one would want to live here. The second reason is that if we have a clean community, children would want to play in a cleaner area instead of a messy one.

The third reason is that if there is litter on the ground then it will attract mice and disgusting animals and no one I know likes mice running around every where they go. The forth reason we should have a club is that if you want children to learn and if they don't know how to do something then students could tutor them and they will learn and be better at it. the fifth reason is that when people don't have help and they think no one wants to help them then our community would be filthy and abandoned. These are all of the reasons why I think its a great idea to have a club to help the community and the people in it so it will be clean and the people would feel like they are cared and people would want to be their friend.

From,
