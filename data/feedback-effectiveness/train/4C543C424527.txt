I think that driverless cars sound pretty cool. People don't need driverless cars though. When driverless cars are made, people might start texting while the car is driving thinking they're still safe when they could still be in danger. Driverless cars is a good and bad idea, its cool but it could still be dangerous. I think they should not make driverless cars because we don't need them when we can drive on our own. Since it is computer what if hackers hijacked it? Or maybe it messed up because its computer made and the driver has no control? There are many things that could possibly happen since its "computer driven". There was something on the news before about people hijacking cars and other things, think about how easy it could be to get control of a computer driven vehicle, it would probably be more easy. If they are gonna bring them I think they should add security or something, maybe do a whole bunch of tests with devices to make sure that it's safe. This vehicle doesn't just put the driver in danger, but it also can put other peoples life in danger. If a person crashed into another person they could die. I know for sure that when I get older and start driving, I probably wont get a driverless car if they come out because in my opinion I think that these sound pretty dangerous and I don't wanna get hurt or something to happen. This actually probably could help people who are hurt/injured who can't drive get to places possibly. So I think maybe they could add them aslong as they make sure its as safe as possible.
