I think that the use of the technolohy should not be used because then parent would be complaining how it is not fair for a teacher or students to know her sons/daughters expression. Also I personally think that we shouldn't allow them because then teachers would always be focused on the kids that aren't as happy and are confused on the work or lesson they are learning. I also think that it would also be a good idea for the whole school because if a student is to shy to speak up and they dont know how to do something then the teacher can talk to him/her after class. I think that using this technology will be to much too and the school will have to use millions of dollars just to buy some for a whole class. I know this becuase the author says "Your home PC can't handle the complex algorithms used to decode mocode Mona Lisa's smile. Then they show us how we can do it at home and how we can make use smile or happy. In the artical is states "According to the Facial Feedback Theory of Emotion, moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions, but also may even help produce them. ("Putting on a happy face" actually works" So at the end of the day I personally don't think we schools should have this type of technogoly and be more focused on other technologys like finger print sign in or school resources.
