Dear Senator,

I highly recomind keping the Electoral college. I personally recomind keeping Electoral college because in sourse one it states that the "Electoral college was established in the Constitution as a compromise between election of the president by a vote in congress and  election of the president by a popular vote of qualified citizens."... The Electoral College is "widely regarded as an anachronism" a non-democratic  method of selecting a president that ought to be over ruled by declaring the canidate who receives the most popular votes the winner. This way it is fair. Did you know that when you vote for a presidential canidate you are really voting for a slate of electors?

It is possible that the winner of the electoral vote will not win the national popular vote. In the Electoral College they avoid the problems of the elections which no canidate recevies a majority of the votes cast. Also the Electoral College restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states by the population lose by virtue of the mal-apportionment of the senate decreed in the constitition.

As a citizen of the the United States of America i feel that if we use the Electoral College, it would make things so much easier on us.

sincerally,PROPER_NAME
