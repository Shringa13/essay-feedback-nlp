I think that it would be useful in a classroom because sometimes the teacher cant always read the students facial expressions and will keep teaching the same boring class. But if we used the new technology that could read the kids faces and change the course of the class to make it more interesting, then more kids wouldn't be bored all the time and they will be able to learn more about the subject that they are learing about.

The new technology could also save more money by not having to have alot of teachers in the classrooms and they could use for food, newer technology, and maybe a better building. Also kids might not like some of the teachers that are in the classrooms and the teachers might not like the kids that are in their either, so with the new technolgy replacing a teacher would save them arguments with the kids and teachers.

That is why i think that we should emplement this new technology into our school systems.
