First i disagree that all students should have at least one extracurricular activity because most of the students spend most of their time outside running, playing different sports and more they could get stressed by having to play sports each time of day and as a result the students could lose interest of playing sports.

Next i think that students might not need an extracurricular activity because each student has a gym class, in gym class each students does many different activitys including excerise, paser, sit in reach, jumping jacks and other different activitys.

Thirdly the students could get tired causing them to not pay attention to the teacher and they could miss important information that the teacher is teaching them and that will cause the student to get a bad grade in class and fail the class.

Finally students shouldn't have an extracurricular activity because it could make the students very stressed and tired at school and they spend their time outside to play sports also students have gym classes where they do many different activitys.
