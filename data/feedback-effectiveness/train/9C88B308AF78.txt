At first, this face is just a natural landform. Most of the people believe that there is no alien in this world. Scientist figured it was just Martian mesa, common enough around Cydonia, only this one had unusaul shadows that made it look like an Egyptan Pharoah.

Secondly, the scientist keep researching whether is this an alien or it just a natural landform. A few days later NASA unveiled the image for all to see. The caption noted a ¨huge rock formation.....which resembles a human head...formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes,nose, and mouth.¨ They found this information so some people might think it an alien because it has head,eyes,nose,and mouth.¨

Lastly, it has since become a pop icon. It has starred in a Hollywood film, appeared in books, magazines, radio talk shows, and even haunted frocery store checkout lines. Although few scientist believed that Face was an alien artifact, and some people believed that it was just a landform. When Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time, Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the orginal Vikins photos. Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing..... a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all. I think it was just a landform and many people argue about this.
