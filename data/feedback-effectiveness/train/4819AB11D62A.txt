Well, I think that students should have community service because it will help people and make them feel happy. If you go to the nursing home and help the old people, they will feel very good. If you pick up trash from the side of the road, then people in the community will think that you did a good job. Then the community will be pretty.

Everything you do for the people at the nursing home feel good when you do something for them. Their children might not come and visit them and help them. So they want to be really happy if their about to die or their really sick. You will also feel good after you do something good for them.

The community should look very nice because what if someone famous comes to the community. What will they think? They'll probably think that the students or adults don't do anything for the community. So not just juveniles should pick up the trash for the community. High school students and adults should just volunteer to pick up trash on the side of the road. instead of getting paid for it.

Volunteer work is about helping people and helping the community. It's not about helping people or the community and getting paid for it. Some famous people do volunteer work. So why shouldn't students and adults that don't have jobs do the volunteer work. We should be really nice to the community because its a great place to live at. We should also be nice to the old people because their old, some are sick, and some might die soon.
