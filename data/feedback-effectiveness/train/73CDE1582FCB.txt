Public schools are not always the best to attend. Thats why some schools have other options for kids/ parents that dont want to attend them or dont want there children attending them. There usually a lot of bad situations that happen in public schools. There a lot of disrespect that come from the students that dont care about school. Students skip classes to fight or be disruptive.

This is why i think Homeschooling or home bound is a wonderful thing to have. Some kids never wanna get up and come to school so they end up skipping school. So having this "Distance Learning" stuff is a wonderful thing to have. Even when kids dont wanna come to school they can still learn and get there education from the comfort of there own home.

When doing home bound, you get assigned to a teacher and they pick up your work for you and come to your home or where ever else yall wanna meet and do the work together in case the student has any questions. The students and teacher would meet at least twice a week so the teacher can teach the student a new lesson on what they are teaching in school. The one bad thing about home bound is that you cant work while on home bound. Although not being able to work isnt that much of a problem for students on home bound.

Students that get home schooled by there parents or another adult have a little bit more freedom then kids on home bound because they have teachers that check on them and make sure they are doing there work and turning it in on time.

I believe home schooling and or home bound is a wonderful thing to have for kids. I feel that we learn better when were alone and get to study a subject or unit as long as we need so we know it. In school units get taught so fast that students that learn slower than others dont really have a chance to get to know it. In conclusion i love the fact that we have al these different opertunitys for everyone.
