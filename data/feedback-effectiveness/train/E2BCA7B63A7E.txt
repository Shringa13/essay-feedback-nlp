Why should cars be limited? Theres really no reasson why. Its what would happpen with or with out them. I see that all cars are is a deadly machine that can kill anyone at anytime. over a hundred inasent people die every mouth by a car accident or and motorised viache colision.

Theres some places around the world where cars are limited to residents owning a car. For example: Vauban, Germany. Just because theres to many people that do not own any type of transportation have to walk the streets and so the people that own cars have a hard time trying to get places with all the people crowding the streets. when theres to mant people walking it beggins to back up traffice to a point people give up there cars to actual get to their work on time or to see a movie before it starts. I belive cars should be limited to the point where people have to walk. To cut down the obesity rate.
