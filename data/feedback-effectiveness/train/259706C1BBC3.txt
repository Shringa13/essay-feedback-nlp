The creation of "smart cars" is new and exciting, but is it safe? Multiple car companies are working on cars that drive themselves. Tesla claimes that they will release a car capable of driving on autopilot 90% of the time by 2016. Also Mercedes-Benz, Audi, and Nissan plan to have cars that can drive themselves by 2020.

Google has had cars that have been on the road independently since 2009. Their cars have driven more than half a million miles without a crash, so far. Google cars arn't truly independent, they are required to have a person in the car to take the wheel in case of simply pulling in or out of a driveway or complicated traffic issues.

In most states it is illegal to even test the computer driven cars. California, Nevada, Florida, and the Dristrict of Columbia have led the country in allowing the use of semi-autonomous cars. It should be illegal in most states, because it is dangerous. If one of these "smart cars"

were to crash who is responsible? The driver,the car company, or the state? New laws will be needed to cover liability incase of an accident, in these states before the cars are tested.

All of these "smart cars" that have been created, and are on the road still need a person in the car. Why would someone want a driverless car that needs someone in it? All these big name car companies are claming to have these "driverless cars" soon, but how safe is it going to be for states, and pedestrians on the streets? If these "smart cars" are created, states need to make sure that the cars are 100% safe for everyone.
