Dear Senator,

I, like the job you are doing and you're doing it quite well. But what is this electoral college? You are telling me that i vote for electors thta supposedly are pulling fior my choice of candidate for pesident. I don't think that is right to just take my choice of president and put it in someone else's hands. It should be my choice to whom I want it to be. Now I realize that there is probably some rule that prevents them to changing their mind, but actually I don't think that there is such a rule. I think that we should be rid this Electoral College and go by popular vote. So this way my vote is directly counted and going towards the candidate of my choice. Now I know that ths would be a big thing because it is unconstitutional, so we should have a vote upon what the people think. Whether we should keep up with this electoral college buisness. Another thing, why wasn't I, a american, told about all of this. Because my vote probably doesn't even matter now that i think about it, it's probably just a trashed paper that goes toward these electors. How doesd these electors just get chosen, do you wof your way up or you get it if your popular? What would happen if these electors just went with a different candidate and left all the voters in the dust? If so that this happened what would happen to the election? I have questions and i need answers.

GoodbyeÂ
