studying venus is something that you would have to do because you would take a sample of the planet and test it and you would have to see if theres oxygen on the planet and how many years the planet has lived and the arthor has made a story on how they would examine the planet like the NASA would have a little space craft thing that would hover over the planet so they could inspect the ground of venus and the planet could have temperatures around 170 degrees and the air pressure will be like sea level on earth but it could be survivable for humans. venus is a planet that has been around for hundreds of years and its known for the rings around the planet and it excees over 800 fehernhite and the air pressure would be 90 times greater then earth and it would be extreame than anyone has ever encountered on planet earth. the author wrote this is so readers would understand on how venus is and how people are studying it how many cool things are on the planet and other things like venus is called the ''evening star'' is because its the birghtest star even amature stargazer would see it. venus is the second planet from the star and its also named as earths ''twin'' because its second from earth and its earth terms of density and size its dangerous because no aircraft or spaceship has ever survived more than two hours on it.
