I think there is some good things about the Electroal College but some things I do not agree. Overall I believe that we should change the Electoral College. It takes to much time add all the votes and the persents to see who got the most of the votes. Than the senate and the house of representative talk about is and check if they counting is right. Not every one gets to vote.

Maybe if all people got to vote it will be better and will be ble to find out a better count because each state has so many  electoral votes. The thing I don't like is that not everyone has the right to vote and the should. It should be a freedom to vote after this is a free country. We also have the freedom of speech why can't we have a freedom to vote. I may understand that not all people are from this country but reall who is thatb is what make us different but, if we would understand it well be better for every to vote. That way it will be more fair than having only those that qulify.

Another thing is that when we vote the add up how mant people voted for this person and how many voted for the other and that n there they decided who won that state. add up the electoral vote but what happens to the other who wanted the other person they get pushed away and it should be like that. Those people should get a say in who the want too not automaticly be part of the one who won that state.

We should change the way we vote for our persident in the way it will become more equal and not asume it is right. To me the elctoral college just rounds up the vote in the state elector. We should and give everyone a chance too vote of course they would be 18 and older but, aleast to try maybe the outcome well be better and more fair towards to election.
