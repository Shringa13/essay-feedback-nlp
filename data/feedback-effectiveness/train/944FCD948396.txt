Dear Mr. Principal 1/8/11

I don't think that you should not change the school policy.

I think that people work hard enough to get into sports already.

Getting a B average can be difficult.

Students need time to practice sports too.

I agree that students need to have good grades to play sports.

Part of the reason is because most students right now would not be able to play because they have a C average.

I think most students should be allowed to get a couple of C' s because it is a passing grade.

What if sport players don't understand one class but do ok in other classes that's not fair to them.

Players will also think that if they cant play because they don't have a good enough grade average they might think that they are letting people down.

All students have been talking about this.

Some students are better at sports than school work.

Maybe you will consider that changing the school policy will be a bad idea.

You may think different But i hope you will change your mind.

If students cant play any sports than who will represent us in the school?

If students did not write you, you should take some time and ask them what they think.

I hope you can clearly see the other side to this now.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
