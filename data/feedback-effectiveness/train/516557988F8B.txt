Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I believe that the policy of having at least a B average to participate in school sports or activities is the correct thing to do. I believe this because, students who don't have at least a B average, or better, won't be able to handle having a good grades in school. They'll either be to busy to not do homework or to lazing to do school work. Or the student will be too sleepy in class. Also the student might not be focusing in school as much as they used to.

My first reason for this policy to be passed is that, if the below B average student goes to his or hers sport practices or meetings they would probably neglect their homework and school work. Which would cause the student to get an even lower grade average! Unlike with an A or B student who would always at least try to complete their school work and homework.

Another good reason to pass this policy of yours would be that, the student wouldn't have enough sleeping time, which again would make them struggle in school even more. If the below B average student was actually worried about their below average gradethey would
