Luke Bomberger makes the choice to go over seas to and ship horses, cows, and mules to Europe. Luke had knew this would a one time chance to go over seas with his friend, Don. They both signed up for the "Seagoing Cowboys" to watch over and care for the cows, horses, and mules while they go over sea. Luke is brave to do this cause a lot of people just are scared to go across the world.

The bravery shown in Luke is when he goes to diferent places around the world in Europe. Even when there is a terrible storm upon them. In paragraph seven the author states " One rainy night, after making his hourly report to the captain, he slid sown a slippery ladder on his backside of the ship. Luke's heart raced as he shot feet first toward an opening on the side of the ship. A small stirp of metal along the edge stopped slide, keeping him from flying overboard into the dark Atlantic. He was happy to be alive." After that terrible time Luke was brave enough to keep working on the ship later. Which takes a lot of guts to do or to be brave like Luke.

In the end Luke was very bliss to be working with his friend. Luke says in paragraph eight "It made me more aware of people of other countries and their needs." In that sentence he was more worried about the people than himself. Not a lot of people have the guts to do that. In conclusion, Luke was brave to work to all the stuff over seas and give the people who were affected in war what they needed no matter what.
