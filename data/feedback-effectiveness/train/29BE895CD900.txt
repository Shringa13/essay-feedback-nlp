There is a deabate wether Electoral College should or shouldn't be alowed. I thing we should keep it because this everyones right to vote. alos it is in the constition.

Electoral Colleges should be abole to vote because it can sway votes "Electoral College method of selecting the president may turn off potential voters". This quote shows that it can sway the voters because they voted for them and theay vote for that person to be the next president.

The bad thing about Electoral Colleges is if there a run-off election "The presidentail election process, is reduced by the Electoral College, which invariably produces a clear winner...." I took it as the Electoral Colleges is the ones to chose the out come of it so why do we vote then if they chose at the end of all of it.

the last reason Electoral College should be abole to vote is that they dont have all the controle "A dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College vote is possible-it haqppened in 2000- but it's less likely than a dispute over the popular vote". This shows that the people can also way the vote the way they want it to go if there is a larg amount of you that agree.

These are the reasons I thing Electoral College people should be abole to vote. everyone should be abole to vote because it is everyones freedom to vote for what they want.Â
