Hi my name is Luke Bomberberg and I want you to join my program because it is a nice thing to do for the sick people. It may take a long time to get there and back but hey its worth the wait to help the sick. You also get to explore new places around the world with me and my friend,it also gets you exercising because there is a lot of heavy things like the hay barrels. This programis also really really safe. annother thing is that there are about 335 horses, so if you are affraid of horses then this program isn't for you.

In 1945 we went to New Orleans to get started with our program on the SS Charles W. Wooster. I turned 18 when we finally made it to Greece wich meant that I could be drafted for military servrice. By the time I was discharged in 1947 I had made nine trips,the most of any Seagoing Cowboy. It took about two weeks to cross the Atlantic Ocean from the eastern coast of the United States and a month to get to China. When I was a little boy,helping out on my aunt Katie's farm had prepared me for hard work,but not from the dangers at sea.

On my second trip I served as night watchman. My job was to check on all the animals every hour every night. One rainy night after making my hourly report to the captain I slid down a slippery ladder on my backside. My heart raced as I shot feet first toward an opening on the side of the ship. A small strip of metal aalong the edge stopped my slide keeping me from flying overboard into the dark Antlantic.

I found time to have fun on board,especially
