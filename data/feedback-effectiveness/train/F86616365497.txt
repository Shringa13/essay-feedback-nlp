Dear principal

I am writing to you today on the subject of community service. I do not support this requirement, not because i think it is bad, but the time it would take would be too much for some students. Some students are already very busy, and adding community service projects would just make it busier, and harder on them. Some students play sports, and have practices every night, others have band rehearsals. On top of all that, they all have homework, putting required community service projects on top of all that would confuse us students, we would have trouble focussing on our academics if we have to worry about getting so many things done. I myself am in many extracurricular activities, i play many sports, i play in the band, and i sing in the choir, i have a sports practice every night, and i have homework to do after that. To me, requiring community service would set me over the limit. I myself am already extremely busy every night, and having to worry about getting my community service projects done would be too much for me to handle. i also have many friends that play many sports, and other things. We are all very busy already, we barely have enough time now to do even our homework. I cant imagine how crazy my life would be if i had to practice sports every night, practice my musical instrument, and still find time in a week to do community service projects.

Thank you for your time

Sincerely, STUDENT_NAME
