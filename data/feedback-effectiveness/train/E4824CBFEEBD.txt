Do you think we should put facial action coding system in our classroo? I think using technology to read the emotions expressions in a classroom is a good thing because it tells you where your students are bord in class, see if they are mad in class, and tell someone is tired in the classromm.

See if the someone is bord in class is a good thing because you can make the subject or class more fun. That will make the student pay more attention in class because they won't be messing or not paying attention in class any more. In paragraph 6 it says "A classrom computer could recoginze when a student is becoming confused or bored." What they meant by that is the computer would put a different lesson than instead making the student do the lesson being bord or confussed. That will help a lot of students because they are gonna learn more and get good grades.

The facial action coding system could tell a person if they are tired because the computer can tell by their muscles. It will tell the teacher wich student is tired so they teacher can do something about it. It will help out a lot of the teachers from telling who's falling asleep.
