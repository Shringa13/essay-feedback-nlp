Because Venus has all proprties that humans requied to inhabit.

Also, Venus had an extremely temperatures that humans can't survived.

As the author said "the temperature of Venus pass the 170 degress fahrentheid", this means that humans can't resist this temperatures.

Years ago scientist fund something interesting in Venus but also dangereous, venus can be inhabit???, how we can travel to Venus???

Also the Nasa do programs to send people to Venus and study the ecosism.

Venus the secund planet of the solar sistem. Scientis fund that Venus maybe can be inhabit, because they fund properties that Earth posees. But now Venus is like pangea, a dangerous planet with dangerous gasees, earthquakes, etc.

and now, the humanity want to know how to lived in Venus.

Venus is a planet that we can study, survived etc. But also it take a lot of time to do programs and prepare the people, also we are close to put the first step on Venus.

thank you....
