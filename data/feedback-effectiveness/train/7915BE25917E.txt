If technology, that can read and tell your emotions is put into a classroom, then many students wouldnt be focused on schoolwork theyll be focused on a dumb app or piece of technology that can read your emotions. With this advanced technology students will just keep changing if there smiling, if their mad, sad, glad, etc. and checking if the technology can actually do its job. Teachers would probably be doing the same and would not be focused on teaching instead focused on a laptop or computer that can read emotions. Emotions are shown everywhere whether your sad or happy anyone can tell by the way your acting or the way you look. We dont need technology to tell us how we feel or how were supposed to feel. What if the technology tells you a wrong emotion, like what if your happy but it says your mad. Then that'll be the people that made it mad. If we could actually have technology that does that like when a add pops up and you get mad then another one pops up and your happy then another one could pop up and it could be innapropiate. This technology would probably even be far to expensive because its "advanced" and how cool schools afford it then. Schools should not even try to afford this technology it will be really expensive.
