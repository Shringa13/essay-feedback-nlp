You are presented with one of the toughest choices in your life.

As a gift, you received two tickets to Disney World.

One is for you, and the other is for whoever you choose.

All of a sudden, a million questions and possibilities fill your head.

Would you rather go to Disney World with your best friend or your significant other?

What about your brother, uncle, or mom?

With a problem like this, you have to seek advice.

Have you ever had an issue so tough that you needed to seek advice?

I know for certain that I have encountered this problem before.

With issues like that, I always seek advice from numerous people before making my final decision.

I believe seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice because you can hear other people's points of view, determine what the best choice is by finding which answer is said most, and learn life lessons from the people you seek advice from.

A big reason you should seek advice from more than one person is because you can hear different points of view.

By asking many people for advice on the situation, you encounter people that are wiser, smarter, and far more experienced than yourself.

For example, I remember encountering a situation as a fifth grader where I had to choose between saving my money or buying a new gaming system.

I had been saving this money since fourth grade, and I had accumulated more than four hundred dollars.

When I went over to my cousin's house, I was able to play on his gaming system, and I thought it was really fun.

Before I left, I made sure to ask him if I should invest in the same gaming system or to save the money.

His response was to buy the system.

Even though I got the advice I needed, I made sure to ask other people the same question.

Next, I remember asking my parents if it would be worth it.

My mom had told me that we already had lots of video games.

On the other hand, my dad told me that it was my money, and if this is what I decided to spend is on, it was completely fine.

After seeking multiple points of view, I had finally made my decision.

I was going to buy the gaming system.

To this day, I still play on that console, and I do not regret my investment.

After asking many people, you start to see a pattern in answers.

In my case, I figured out that the majority of people I asked said it was a good idea to buy the console, and this leads into my next point.

Asking many people for advice can also be beneficial because you can determine what the proper choice is by examining what answer people reply most.

If we go back to my story about whether or not to buy the console, the answer I received most was, "Yes."

Ultimately, that was a big factor that told me I should buy the console.

If you ask many people the same question and you get the same answer, whatever they are telling you is probably the smart and correct thing to do.

It may not necessarily be the decision you were thinking of making, but it may be one to consider.

Back at the beginning of the school year, my English teacher assigned our class a project where we have to make a difference in our community.

At first, my idea was to organize a community-wide sports equipment drive.

When I got home that day, I discussed my idea with my parents, and they told me that was not the best idea, and that we should sit down and discuss a better idea.

I decided I wanted to prove them wrong.

Fast forward a couple of months, and I am struggling to get anything done on the project.

That night, I told my parents that my idea would not work, and they just gave me that "I-told-you-so" look.

From there, we devised a plan where I would instead help the volunteers on the Blue Ridge Parkway.

Right now, my project is going great, and I am close to crossing the finish line of completion.

From that, I learned that you need to take advice of others because, in my case, my parents knew what they were talking about.

If multiple people tell you that something is not the right choice, then you should probably reconsider.

That was a life lesson I needed to learn, but from seeking advice from more than one person, you learn many life lessons.

Last but not least, asking more than one person for advice can teach you very valuable life lessons that will help along the path of life.

From my experience of failure from my school project, I learned that even though you think your idea sounds good, you should still be open to improvement.

My decision on buying something I wanted taught me opportunity cost.

From asking people for advice, you can learn may valuable things that will assist you.

Not only do these decisions affect a singular situation, but they can be applied to life very easily.

Now, if I am interested in purchasing anything, I always weigh the options, and ask others what the best thing to do would be.

I learned that skill from asking people for advice.

These are the lessons that are learned first hand.

You do not just read them in a book, but instead, you are taught by experience and others.

After asking for advice from numerous people, you ultimately decide that you want to take your brother with you to Disney World.

Though those people you did not choose may feel bummed out, you know you made a good, educated choice because you took advice not just from one person, but from many.

If you had only asked one person, they could have told you to take your grandfather, dog, cousin, son, etc.

Instead, asking many people gave you a better grasp on the situation, ultimately allowing you to determine the best choice is to take your brother.

Asking many people for advice before making a decision is a good choice because you can examine other people's opinions on the situation, figure out what the best choice is by finding the most common answer, and learn many life lessons.

So the next time you face a difficult choice, ask more than one person for advice before coming up with your verdict.
