Can you believe that there is a face on Mars!? The Face on Mars is actually not a face but a natural landform for the following reasons, the facial features are just shadows, there isn't any real proof that aliens created it, and scientists have research that is proof of it not being alien-made.

The first reason is the facial features are just shadows. It would be nice if it was actually nad by an alien. Sadly, it isn't true. It is proven that it is actually just a huge rock formation. (Paragraph 3) "The authors reasoned it would be good way to engage the public and attract attention to Mars. (Paragraph 3)

Secondly, there isn't actual proof that aliens created it anyways. There isn't any proof that aliens are even completely real. It is said in the article "Perhaps, said skeptics, alien markings were hidden by haze." (Paragraph 8). So, they do not have any actual real proof.

My last reason is that scientists have done research to prove that aliens did not really creat this face in Mars. Scientists had seen this photeo in the winter of April '98. Someone would have to peer through the camera through wispy clouds. (paragraph 8).

The reasoning for believing aliens did it is that people want to believe. They want to believe that another race of people can exsist. Maybe the aliens are jsut sending a message that they are real. Wem will never really know for sure sadly.

You can belioeve what you would like to. I believe that the face is just a landmark because the facial features on the face is just a few shadows, scientists have done research on this case, and there isn't really any proof that aliens created it. You may believe what you would like to. But, do you want to believe in something real or made up?
