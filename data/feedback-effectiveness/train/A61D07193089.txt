Dear Principal,

This policy is unreasonable, it is because some kids that love sports only have a c average and are trying their hardest. Also when you take away sports and other activities from students, you are taking away their exercise. When you take away a students exercise you could make them have a risk of death. Also some kids might have a disorder that will keep them away from doing their work, and can only get a c average. And those kids with disorders might love sports or other activities, and you are keeping them away from that. Wouldn't you feel bad knowing you would be taking away something that other people love to do.

Also what could happen is that the people that can only get a c average could get mad or jealous at the people with a b average or better. So that would cause a lot of problems in school. There could be more fights then usual. Or people could just stop caring about their grades if they cant get better then a c average trying their hardest. This problem could get you fired because it wouldn't be a good school.

So say some kids at your school are having a rough time at home and the only thing that makes them happy is sports. But they only have a c average because of their home life. They wont be happy ever again if they cant do what they love.

What happens when a kid that has a b average, gets one bad grade and goes down to a c average in the middle of the season and is the best player?

All I'm saying is that it wouldn't be fair to the students if you were to follow through with this policy. Too many kids love sports and have a c average.
