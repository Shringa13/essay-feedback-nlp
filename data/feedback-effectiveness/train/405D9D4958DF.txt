Making technology that can identify human emotions would be important, but not very much in everyday use. If a student were not able to identify their emotions when seeing a therapist or school counsoler, then this device would work best their specifically because therapists/counsolers are trained to help with humans and their emotions.

Let's say that students are in a class to learn about psychology or somethig of the sort. It would be very useful to find out what a person is feeling down to the percent. This device would also be helpful there because it tells you about the muscles that move to show a certain emotion. 'For example, your frontalis pars lateralis muscle (above your eyes) raises your eyebrows when surprised...' (D'Alto paragraph 3); students can study their muscles that make their emotions by learning about these muscles.

In paragraph 9, it states '...Theory of Emotion, moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions, but also may even help produce them'. Just by making faces and using this technology, students can learn so so much more about their emotions on a deep level that can help in many ways. It would benefit students, teachers, therapists, and more.

In conclusion, this device and technology can help many different people in many ways. Students can learn about their facial muslces, therapists can help their clients learn to identify what emotions they are feeling, parents can hep understand how their children are feeling, etc etc. Students can even help one another feel better in small classroom situatioins all together.
