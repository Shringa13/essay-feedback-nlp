Do you think the Face on Mars is a legit person or just a landscape? Is it just mother nature pulling tricks on us? I think it's just a landscape trick. It happens all the time. Like the potatoe with a face on it. Here is why. First, the face doesnt seem to have a body attached to it. Second it looks like it is attached to the ground and, third there has been no sign of life on mars.

First of all th face looks like it was sculpted. It has no body that can be seen. Unless it is a decatetated head. The land scape couldv'e played an trick on us.

Second of all It looks attached to the ground. If it were a readl head the end outline wouldnt be smoothed in to the ground. It would be laying on top and have a shadow showing the back side the the skull.

Third, there have been no sign of life on mars. Yes, we have found flowing water but we have not found any type of living orgamisim.

So here is why I think that the landscape is playing illousions on us. First, The face looks scultped. Second, It lookes attached to the ground and third, there is no sign of life on mars.
