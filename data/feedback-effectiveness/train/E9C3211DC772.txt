Dear State Senator

I would rather want the changing of the election to popular vote because the Electoral college process causes many promblems. First is that it consists of 538 electors and only 270 electoral votes is required to elect the president(source 1). Also perhaps it leads into a tie in the electoral votings.... it could possibly lead into a deadlocked election(source 1). This process of electoral college does not give the full rights to the voters... its not fair.

My first reason why you guys should change the election to go by popular votes is it causes many promblems, 538 electors is consisted of and only 270 electoral votes is required to elect the president. this tells me that NO people can vote which really does not give you the right to do that because people have always that right to vote. In addition to that it can lead to a big catastrophe. The electoral college process is unfair to voters.

Also why, all that can lead into a tie in the electoral votings. Which equals into a deadlocked election. Lastly, this process is outdated and irrational. arguments against direct elections are spurious and should completely vanish this process.
