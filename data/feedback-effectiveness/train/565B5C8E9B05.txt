This story is about evaluating The Challenge of Exploring Venus. In the first paragraph it is kinda misleading because it says that venus sometimes called the evening star is one of the brightest points of light in the night sky. Then it goes on to talk about how venus is also a planet so the name is very misleading. Then paragraph two it talks about how its a planet again not a star and its saying that its the closest planet to earth.

Venus is the closest planet to earth and yet to there has been a spacecraft to survive the landing. Although it could be a little bit tough seems haw venus's atmosphere is almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets and the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in venus's atmosphere. On venus surface the temperatues average over 800 degrees fahrenheit. With that kind of heat and pressure could even crush a submarine.

In conclusion the story had some great details about what venus was like compared to earth but i also think that it was a little misleading about star planet and i think that could have been fixed up so it didnt have you on your toes trying to find out wether or not it was a star or a planet that was earths twin.
