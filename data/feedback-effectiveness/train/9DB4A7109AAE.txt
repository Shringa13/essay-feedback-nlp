Dear state senator, we should do Electoral College because it will be easier to vote and will only use votes of qualified citizens. The Electoral College has a consist selection of the electors, the meeting of electors where they can vote for President and Vice President, and counting electoral votes by congress.

The Electoral College has 538 electors, and majority of 270 electoral votes that is required to elect the presedent. Also, under the 23rd amendment of the constitution, the distric of columbia is allocated 3 electors and treated like a state for this reason, the word "state" also refers to district of columbia.

Plus, the presidential election is held every 4 years on a Tuesday after the first Monday of in November, and when you choose your states electors when you vote for president, you also are actually voting for your candidates electors. After the presidential election, the governor of your state prepares a listing of all the candidates who ran for President in your state along with the names of their respective electors called, "Certificate of Ascertainment".

Your state also sends a Certificates of ascertainment to the Congress and National Archives as part of the official records of thee presidential election. The Electoral College is also a widely regarded as an anachronoism, which is a non-democratic method of selecting a president that ought to be overruled by the candidates who recieved the most popular votes the winner.

This positions are correct in arguing that the Electroal College method is not democratic in modern sense, but it is the electors who elect the president, not the people. When people vote for the president they are actually voting for a state of electors. The outcome of this meathod is that the Electoral College vote is possible but its less likely to dispute over the popular vote. That is why we should do Electoral College.
