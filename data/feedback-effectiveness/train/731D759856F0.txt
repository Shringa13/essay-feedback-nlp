Dear Principal,

I think that yes, our school should participate in community service such as picking up litter and helping out elders and elementary children. The reason being because

I think in this society now a days children and others need to take a little more of responsibility and also it will make a change in our society. Imagine if ,for example us kids and adults helped out elementary children, such as being a tutor, kids would get better grades on the star testing and SAT's.

Another reason would be it would help out with discipline. A lot of children need to understand the meaning of discipline, self control, and respect. If we as kids started helping elementary children with school, not only grades but etiquette and respect, people in general would be nicer and maybe at our schools now a days their wouldn't be as many bullies.

Also, in the elder department it would also be a big help for children at our school. The reason being is that it would help us, once again be respectful and understand that in life, you get old, and sometimes gaining age could effect your memory or even, take over how your body works. We could also learn to live life to the fullest and stop caring about who has the new phone or purse exc.

Lastly, having community service could get us ready to have a stable job and understand the responsibility of it when we have one. Who wants to get fired on the first day right?

So yes, principal, I do think at our school we should put out community service it will help us children with responsibility, respect, and discipline. Thank you.
