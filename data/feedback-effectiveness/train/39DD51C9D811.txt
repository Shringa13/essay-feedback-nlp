Deer Senator:

They should keep the Electoral college, Because its where people vote to choose who's going to be the president and the vice president. If they have 538 electors they have to count them all not 270/538 because its not fair. I am Agree with the "Certificate of Ascertainment" they can have a certificate even if they did not won.

The State conventions, the presidential candidates, the state party's central committee they all should vote or choose at the same time. Voters get confused because the state convention, presidential candidates and the state central committee don't make up their minds....Why American people should considere themselves lucky if that was Back in 1960's, what makes them so sure that American people are going to be lucky again? well they might get lucky this time but not always they're going to be lucky every year its difficult and we are in 2015 now.

People should STOP thinking about what happen in the 1960's it might happen again okay but that was 45 years ago. Why A catastrophe? why cant they live in peace and stop hatting or whatever's going on.

If they keep doing that it might be a fight or a war between them, and we dont want any fights or wars this year. The electoral college have to change for good if they dont they wont see any votes when its time to vote..Segregationists they have to stop being rasists because people from all over the world are voting for them and they are all from different races.
