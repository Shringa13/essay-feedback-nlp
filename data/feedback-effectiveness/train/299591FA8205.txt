Dear principal ,

Community service has been part of many peoples lives in this world. Many people do community service to help others and better this world. Well i think doing community service should be a grown ups job to do not a student or any kid in the world. Students shouldn't be wasting their time i something they don't want do. They have a lot in head for ex. school , homework , siblings they have to take car of , after school programs , and sports they have to go to go to ! I understand doing community service is a good thing to do in this world , but kids shouldn't do it at all ! Some students should be require but not all ! If a student is failing a class or classes and needs points to pass their class require them to do community service. All students shouldn't to be require to do community service , only the people that need it. Its just a waste of time in a kids life , even though they know that they are doing something good in this world by helping others.
