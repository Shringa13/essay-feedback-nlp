Dear, Mr. Principal 2-1-11

I think students should not perform community service because it would seem like they were getting punished for something they didn't do. Doing community service would take too much time from doing school work students rely need. If students decide to clean up the community then they should be able to do it. If a student were to do something to brake the rules then they should be sentenced community service as a punishment depending on there crime. for example if a student were to start a fight the student should do a number amount of hours doing community servis. The students that chose to clean their community should be provided the tools to do the job because they don't have to do anything and some kids cant afford to do so. for example if a student needs a tool the city should provide it. I think if the student wont to do it then they should do it and get offered to get paid for it because nobody would wont to give up their free time for free.

Your student,
