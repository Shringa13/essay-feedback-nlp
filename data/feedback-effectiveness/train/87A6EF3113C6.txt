The author of "The Challenge of Exploring Venus", uses many scientific facts, data, and explanations to support their idea of exploring Venus. In the passage, many examples are given of why scientists would want to explore the possibilities of the contents of Venus despite all the dangers. The text gives some support like declaring it the most Earth-like planet, the possibility of supporting life forms, and multiple explorations to Venus that have been successful.

Venus' relation to Earth is significant because it is the closest example of another planet like Earth. The author claims that Venus is even called Earth's twin and that not only is it like Earth in its density and size, but also in the distance between the two planets. Even though the planet is very similar to Earth there are challenges to get accurate data on the planet because of the many spacecrafts that were unable to withstand the harshness of the planet. As technology advanced, the author claims that more and more missions to Venus occured, and even around the time of World War II there was a spacecraft that survived in Venus conditions for about three weeks. Venus' conditions are very harmful to the life on Earth but there may have been a possibility that life could sustain on the planet. The author describes Venus as a planet mostly covered in large oceans that could have suppported life growing there. All of these examples that the author has given supports his idea of the need to explore Venus tremedously and gives very convincing evidence and data that supports his idea.

Although Venus is a very harsh planet and there may not be any possibility of life, it would still be worth it to explore this planet and how it works. The author explains in detail what Venus is like and supports his ideas with scientific facts and data. There is a possibility that life could sustain on Venus but that is unknown unless the option is explored.
