In the story Luke's friend played a big role in him becoming a seagoing cowboy, because he invitied him to go to Europe with him. If his friend didn't invite him Luke would not be know. Thats the reason his friend played a big role

On luke's adventurs he travled to alot of places that were left in ruins from World War II.he wold bring cattle from farms hence the name seagoing cowboys. He went to New Orleans,Greece,Europe,China,Venice,and Italy and helped them recover from the war.

When him and the crew would have to go somewhere to pass the time they would play baseball,volleyball,ping pong,fencing,boxing,reading,and whittling. On luke's second trip he was a night watchman, he would check on the animals every hour. On one rainy night after he made his hourly report to the captian he was going down a ladder and sliped then fell on his back causing him not able to work for a couple of days because he craked his ribs.
