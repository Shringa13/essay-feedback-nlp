You can be using that money to buy food for your house or buying new parts for your car.

In Vauban,Germany 70% of the people do not own cars and 57% sold a car just so that they can move to Germany. They have only sold them because in Germany there isnt alot of room thats why they have to descrease the usage of cars too. In the united states some people dont have cars because of the gas price or because they cant really aford a car. In Bogota,Colombia millions of colombians either have hiked,biked,or took buses on a car-free day to aviod traffic jams. There for car usage should be limited.
