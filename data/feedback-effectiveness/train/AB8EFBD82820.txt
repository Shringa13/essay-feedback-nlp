When people ask for advice, they sometimes talk to more than one person. Since they might need help, and they might try to get the most advice possible. I think taking advice from others is really helpful. Three reasons why I think seeking advice can help are new ideas, different mindset, and you can help others.

One effect of taking advice is new ideas. So, what i mean by this is you may have different look on things. math for an example you might be confused on how one person teaches it, but then go to a different person and they teach it a way you understand it. Also, it doesn't have to be about school it can be maybe your having a ruff time at home or something is going on in your social life.

Another reason is you can get a new mindset. Lets say if you were really negative and you went to go seek advice from from therapist. Then you can have a new mindset on how life is and possibly become more positive. Since now that the internet is a thing you can get advice on almost anything. I remember this one time in my life how i was really negative, and i went to someone for help and now i'm more happier then i have been.

My third reason is you can help others. I know what you might be thinking how does this have anything to do with taking advice from someone. Just let me explain. So, lets say if anyone of your friends is having a ruff time and you can give that said person advice. Also you can be a therapist yourself or a life coach. Thats the wonderful thing about the world. You can get advice and give it too.

Mots people usually ask for advice, and they will most likely go to more than one person. Sometimes a person might need help, and so they go to the most advice they can get. I think taking advice from others is helpful. The reason for this is you can get new ideas, a different mindset, and you might be able to help others yourself.
