Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I think that community service is very important and students need to be reminded of that. But its also very time consuming so I believe students should have a choice. You should get parents and community members to sponsor a club for community service. It could be named ASCC or After School Community Cleanup. I personally think the whole problem behind community service with kids is that they believe that it can only be cleaning up litter and such, but we need to remind them that it can also be going to a nursing home or putting on a concert for kids with cancer in the area. Not only would this help out the community but it could be a way to socialize out of school and do work at the same time. Just imagine if the track and field area had no litter at all, if there were multiple trash cans instead of three or four, or even helping make a second loop to pickup children. But see not all children might be able to participate as needed because either they are too little, have a sport, have a doctors appointment or even be allergic to the material your working with. If you do decide to put this club into action Tuesday and Thursday right after school would probably be the most effective and convenient. This is just some of my ideas, so just think about it.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
