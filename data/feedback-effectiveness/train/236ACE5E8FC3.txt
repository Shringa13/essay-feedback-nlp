Okay hey,  I just wanted to introduce myself before we get into this subject my name is PROPER_NAME and i'm writing about changing the Electoral College to election by popular vote. The reason why I am writing about this is because there are a lot of things wrong with the Electoral College and under that sytem, voters don't vote for presidents they vote for slate of electors who then elect the president and can elect someone completely different than who the voter wanted to be president. So there is a possiblity that your not going to wind up getting what you wanted out of the outcome. Also in electoral vote the most worrying thing is the prospect of a tie. In that case, the election would be thrown to the House of Representatives, where the state delegations vote on the president. (The Senate would choose the vice-president on that outcome.) At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to the voters. Because of the winner-take-all system in each state, candidates don't spend time in the states they know they habe no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the "swing" states. During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all, including Rhode ISland and South Carolina, and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didn't get to see a single campaign ad. If anyone has a good argument for putting the fate of the presidency in the hands of a few swing voters in Ohio, they have yet to make it.....

It's official: The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational. THe best arguments in favor of it are mostly assertions without much basis in reality. And the argument in favor of it are mostly assertions without much basis in reality. And the arguments against direct elsections are spurious at best. It's hard to say this, but Bob Dole was right: Abolsih the electoral college!
