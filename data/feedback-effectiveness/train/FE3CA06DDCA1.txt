Why is it when someone asks you for advice there the one's talking most of the time? Here are 2 of the reasons I think that the person who asks for advice talks more than the one who is giving the advice. Reason 1 is they might want to give the on who is giving the advice all the info so then they can help them. Reason 2 is that they are give you as much detail as they have to give you good advice.

They will want to give you all the information so you can probably find a solution or fix to there problem. As in this sit ions where my friend needed some advice for a test she had coming up. She was not sure what to do to study for it. She was telling me what she had to study but then she said ÃÂ¨ I donÃÂ´t think these would help me muchÃÂ¨ I told her to make flash cards out of the note she had then she did that. She was super stress. I think when your stressed you just say things that are on your mind as in you talk more.

If a person wants good advice they will want to give you all the details. If you know all the details you will most likely know how t fix it. Everyone needs so good advice because the how are they going to fix there problem. If you friend has a problem and they dont tel you all the details your not really gonna give then good advice.

In conclusion why you need advice you will talk more then the person who is given you the advice. When you are in a problematic event you will take a lot more because yo will be most likely stressed. Also if you give all the the details of your problem you will get good advice.
