There was an funny looking landform on Mars. That other scientist had tooken a picture of in 1976 and mars that look like a face icon. the picture was blurry and we couldnt really tell what it was so many people had did research on it. Many scientist like me and different people thought it was different things. Like just a regular natural landform in Mars and others think it is a face that a lien had left there to show a icon. We also had a arguent over what it really was. Me as a scientist and other people that thought it was a icon that aliens marked.

I, as a scientist disagree about what many people think it is. I personally think its just a regular natural landmark in Mars. Others think its a icon for something a alien made because its shaped as a face a few scientist believed the Face was an alien artifact. Some people think the face is nonafide evidence of real life on Mars. Us scientist had describe the icon which resembles a human head . its formed bve shawdows giving the illusion of eyes, nose and a mouth. This have attracted alot of people attention to Mars.

This icon have became very popular. For example in pargargraph 5 its says " its starred in Hollywood Films, appeared in books, magazines, and is in radio talk shows. This shows that the icon is really popular and many people know and talk about the icon.

Around April 5 in 1998 Mars global flew over Cydonia for the first time and took a better picture of the icon for we can tell what it was more cleary then the other pictures they had. We discovered that it was just a natural landforn and there wasnt no alien icon.

There was nothing else really said about the natural landform because we know what it is now but we also know that its not essay to target Cydonia.
