The authors suggustin that we should study Venus is worh it even though it will be really hard to get anyhing back from there becasue there is only drownes that could go so that they can pick up rocks"safely far above the planet can provide only limited insight on good "

conditions becasue most forms of light cannot penetrate the dense almosphere " even though we are able to have drownes go there we wont be able to bring any of them back with rocks or some air from that planet. The other reson for them would be that they would have to send real people to go and get some samples but that would be to dangerus

"scientist seeking to conduct a through mission to understand Venus would need to get up close". despite being hard for them to try and study Venus. The authors suggetion on the story is very help full i can see why some peolpe would like to keep on going with there owm this time. even though people might not want to look any closser to Venus i belive it would be alot helpfull if we learn alot more of what is out there in space.
