i think that we should keep the electoral college beause it keeps things in order and people get to vote on which thing or person they want to be president or vice president and without it people couldnt run nor vote for who they think would be better at running office and it consit of 538 electors . they have already had it in why take it away now it keeps things equal and right to all american citizens of the united states of  people wait for every four years to be able to vote on the people they want in office and who they want vice president the one with the most votes is president and the one with fewer votes is vice if there is a tie between the to then they have tokeeo running till one gets the most votes and the other is vice preisdent over 60% iof voters want a direct electon and the rest dont that is over hafe who want it  the elcetoral college is widely regarded as anachronism a non demoractic method  of selecting a president not the people but each party is selected a slate of electors trusted to vote for the partys nominee and it is entirly possible that the winner of the electoral vote will not wine the national pouplar vote there are five reasons for retaining  the electoral college despite its lack of democratic pedigree all them reason not liberal but it is less likely than a dispute over the pupoler vote canditdates share of the vote is possible .

presidnate to have trans regoinal appeal no regon not south north etc. has enough electoral votes to e3lect a president so a soild regon favorite such as rommney was heavily in those states for he gains no electoral votes by increasing his puoplarty in  states the winnwe thake all method of awarding electoral votes includes the candidtates as we saw in 2012 election . i think that there is a good purpose for having the electoral college so people can have ethe freedom to vote equal amoung the mations world wide voteing everyone can speak there mind no matter were they are or where there from any where in the world can vote for there president and vice president the guys who run for president and vice want there votes of the people to make it equal and fair for everyone waniting to be president and live a  good rich life in the white house . everyone wants to be rich and heathle so thta they csn do whatever they want so we have to have a vote on who president and who not the pepople need to see whos runing.

in order ffor the people to have ther rights they need to know there president they let the people let them know there a oppontes and how they will make a good diffrence in the world to all equal rights and none wqual if you  feel like that you dont wanna vote you dont have to vote for anyone and let everyone else vote of ypur sick or whatever may be the problem then you can send a letter to vote instead of walking all the way down there or driving and waisting your gas freedom says you have the right to vote.

peopel all over the world want to vote on a president and vice oresident the people thta have the next hightest votes get to run for election aginst one other person for vice president .i think that the electoraal college is to stay and give the right to ther people all over the world and every where elese in the world the electoral votes it what lwts us speak are minds and us have the right of freedom and equalness over the entier world today in our nation is diffrent than how it use to be wee blacs wasent allowed anything and that only men can vote and women equals right and  diffrent races equal rights of america black folks couldnt run for president neather  i think that america should keep equal we all have to live togather why not live in peace
