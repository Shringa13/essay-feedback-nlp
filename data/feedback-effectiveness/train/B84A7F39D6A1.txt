" The reason that 44 nations joined the program was because, when World War II was over in Europe, and many countries were left in ruins, people around the world had got together from different nations to help these poor people, that got there town destroyed, house/apartments, and also helped the animals get taken care of. In the text it says, " to help these countries recover their food supplies, animals, and more, 44 nations joined together to form UNRRA ( United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration)" UNRRA hired Seagoing Cowboys".

The Seagoing Cowboys are people to help take care of the horses, young cow, and mules that were shipped overseas. Luke had been traveling with food supplies for the aniamals and that people need. On Luke second trip he served as a night watchman, his job was to check the animals every hour. Being a sea going cowboy was much more than a adventure for Luke. It opened up the world for him. Luke was glad that he was able to help other people from other countries to help when World War II ended. He was also glad to help take care of these animals so they can still live.
