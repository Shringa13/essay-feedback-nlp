i don't think its a bad way to test it i say they should test it to one classroom see how it works see what it can do and stuff like that so if you ever want to put theses in classroom's give it to one class to try them out and if they like it use but if they don't u can't do anything but make something better or something just like give it a diffenert name and shape, and size stuff like that beacuse you don't want to give it to a person that dose not like the idea of using it. say you have three classroom's and u want to see what's the odds of these classroom's using these so you test them for like 3 weeks see how use it see if they like do they need help using them so i think it would be great to have in classrooms as long as they like them and know's how to use them is the biggest part of this new product.
