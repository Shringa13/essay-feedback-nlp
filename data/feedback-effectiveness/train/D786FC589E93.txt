Dear senator,

Getting ride of the Electoral College would change so many things. We the people vote for who we want as a president. It should be that the person with the most votes wins. We the people should have a say in who runs our country. I mean we do because we get to vote and all but even if we do vote the Electoral College votes diffrently. Just becasue they and you are in higher power shouldnt mean that you get to pick everything that happends to this country. Yes, I understand that there are really stupid people in this world who make stupid dicisons but we should at least get a vote on like new laws or building something new in town. If we had votes on things like getting stuff torwn down and building new things it would change atol of places. But becauser of the Electoral College we dont have a final say in anything. During the presidency electon one of the candidates will win by the votes of the people but lose beacuse the votes of the Electoral College. That is not right. When the people vote for something or someone they should be able to have a final say in what happends. Say your voting for a new ice cream flavor, well say there is 20 regular people voting and there is 5 from th e"electoral college". Say 13 of you like the new flavor but the other 7 dont like it. Wouldnt you think the 13 should win? But the 5 electoral people still have to vote, and 3 of them vote against the new flavor so there is no new flavor. Wouldnt you be mad if you and the other 12 people who wanted the new flavor didnt win because of higher people above you said no? i know i would. Im giving you all these reasons why the electoral college isnt fair because it needs to change.
