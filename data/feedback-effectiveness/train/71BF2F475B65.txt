By doing a Facial Action Coding to a classroom full of students would be different and interesring. This would be the first time anyone has done something that like. But the results could vary cause of how the students are feeling.

Say there is a girl who is having a really good day, she got asked to Prom and she said yes. It made her day and she was happy for the rest of the day. And then take a boy who was late for the bus and had to walk to school. He would be tired and upset. They both have two different emotions, so the results would be different.

Read this part of the article, "Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor". If a classroom did a scan and all the students were tired, not interested, and ready to go home, the teacher could take those results and make the class more interesring for the students. The students would probably have more fun and want to do the work if the teacher made it fun and interesting for the students. But don't make it too difficult for the students cause they could shut down again.

By doing the Facial Action Coding, the result could be different for some students. But it would be fun and interesting to switch things up a bit and have while learning. By doing the Facial Action Coding, you can see how the students really feel. And it cpuld help them and you (the teacher) get a better understanding of how to teach.
