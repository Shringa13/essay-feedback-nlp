The author supports this idea by giving the facts of how dangerous it is but why we should keep trying to study Venus. The author says a lot about the dangers because there are a lot. And says we could find out more about these dangers and how to defeat them. They set out on a mission to simulate the chaos of Venus's surface and it was able to last three weeks.

NASA is working on a lot of different approaches on how to last a while or have a good landing on Venus. The author tells about the things that we could find out if we could be there for a while. They stress a lot in the passage about it being the hottest planet around and it isn't even the closest to the sun. This is a huge thing holding them back the author says and would melt almost all metal. The author supports this by saying that a submarine that goes very deep in the ocean wouldn't even survive on Venus. The author gives a lot of facts and things to support his claims.

If the author has told a fact they have had soemthing to support it. The author says a lot about the things we can't do with Venus and has something to explain why with it. The author had a lot of facts and examples to help him support his and NASA's facts and ideas. I really like that the author will also give statistics because that is a huge way to support a fact or claim. Overall in this whole passage the author supports all ideas.
