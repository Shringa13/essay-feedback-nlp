Dear Senator,

In all honestly, getting rid of the Electoral College is for the best. It's unfair to the voters. Changing it to election by popular vote for the president of the United States would be easier for the people.

Source 2 states that the Electoral college is unfair for the voters because the candidates don't go to states they don't have a chance of winning, because of the winnner-take-all system. The candidates only focus on the tight races in the swing states. Sorce 2 also claims that in the 2000 election, 17 states didn't see the candidates at all! That's pretty rediculous. And voters in 25 of the largest media markets didn't even get to see a single campaign ad.

In the Electoral College system, voters dont only vote for the president, but for electors, who also vote for the president. Then again, in source 2, the article says the the electors that were voted for can vote for anyone they choose. That's some tricky business.

Voters can't control who the electors vote for. Electors aren't even voted for by the people. They sometimes come from state conventions, sometimes the state party's central committee, sometimes even the presidential candidates themselves. The second article says that the legislature is responsible for picking the electors. And these electors coukd always go against what the people want.

Article 1 says that to Electoral college is meant to be a compromise between election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens. The Electoral College consists of the meeting of electors where they vote for President and Vice President, and the counting of electoral votes by congress.

Doing away with the Electoral Cololege is the best thing to do for the people. IT's unfair and tricky. The people deserve to be respected and not cheated out of their vote by electors.
