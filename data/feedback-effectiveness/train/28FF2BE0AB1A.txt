I think driverless cars would be a very cool thing to have. Also its outside the box not every car can be driverless but some can. Just look a lamborghini or ferrari they dont have as much technology as some of the newer middle class cars do.

But your paying $500,000 for some thing that doesnt have as many features as a prius or a smart car. But also driverless cars arent really driveless if some has to take the wheel and go around some things that means the cars not really driveless

I would rather drive my car than let a computer beacuse technology will always have problems and errors and if that happens gonig down a highway at say 70mph and your car has a problem and you aren't ready for it you may end up in the hospital. Driverless cars will happen one day but not anytime soon cause some states say they arent even legal to drive a computer operated car.
