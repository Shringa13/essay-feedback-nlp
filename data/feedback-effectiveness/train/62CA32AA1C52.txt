Imagine learning about school during summer break. School should not require students to do summer projects in the summer time. Also school shouldn't ruin students free time. Students shouldn't have to worry about school during their free time.

Student designed projects would be way better than teacher designed projects because students have more imagination therefore it would make the project more interesting. If students designed summer projects it would make learning in the summer time better for students. Also if students design these summer projects it would be more students looking forward to learning during the summer because students know what is interesting to each other. And if students design summer projects there will be more into learning about school during summer.

Summer projects should be designed by students because they can influence their peers to be smarter. Also if they are designed by students it can keep people off the streets. It can also bring people together and stop a lot of bullying. And when students come together they can make a big impact on the community and influence other to be smart.

Students make everything interesting. School should be a place where you can have fun while learning. If summer projects was teacher designed it wouldn't be fun and nobody would come to school during the summer time. Students can bring the best out of each other and lift each other up when they are feeling down.

Students can bring the best out of other students better than teachers can. Thats why teachers need to be more involved with their students and lift them up. If one student is having fun learning it would influence the rest of them to wanna be smart and do well. Thats why students should design summer projects it would help a lot of students wanna be smart and make it some where in life.Â
