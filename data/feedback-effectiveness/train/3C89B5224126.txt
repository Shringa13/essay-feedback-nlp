Ugh! Politics are so boring why must we study or do them. But then again there is an upside to it. We get to choose who the president is and how he is going to run the country. Also if we Electoral College vote it would be harder for us to vote.

To begin with, If we changed it it would be harder for us to vote because it is a process made by our founding fathers and it is established in the constitution. It is a compromise between the election of the president and the vote of the citizens and a vote of Congress. The Electoral College process is long it consists of many sections like the electors, meeting the electors so they can vote for the President and the Vice President, and counting the votes everyone thata voted. The Electoral College comsist of 538 vots but thwey only need 270 votes in order to elect a President. With that amount of votes they can become presidents.
