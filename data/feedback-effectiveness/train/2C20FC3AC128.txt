Many people arent sure what to do when it comes to election. Electoral College is the process that consist of the election. I believe that Electoral College is the easist way to handle the way of voting. Any ways whats wrong with Electoral College almost half the people agree to it.

The founding father that discovered Electoral College made it easy for anybody to be president. Many people also agree with me because according to source 2 it says that in case of the election it will be thrown to the House of Representatives where the delegations vote on the president. This way the delegation people can pick who's good for president. On the other hand many people belive that Electoral College is unfair to some people. Many people want to abolish Electoral College.

Secondly, the Electoral college is widely regared as an anachronism a non- democratic method of selecting a president that ought to be declared the candidate who recives the most popular votes. The electoral restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states by the population lose by virtue of the mal- apportionment of the senate. The Electoral college avoids the problem of the elections in which no candidate recieves a majority of the votes cast.

In conclusion I think that Electoral College should stay and it will make things easier for all these reasons I listed from the sources. Also all the presidents will have a chance to become what they want to be.       Â
