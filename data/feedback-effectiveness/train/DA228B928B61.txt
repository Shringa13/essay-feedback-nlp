Would students benefit from taking classes home? Some would agree and disagree. Taking classes online would help students who need that one on one teaching. Some students have a hard time focusing in a noisy environment because other students are disturbing the class whiles they are trying to pay attention.

Students who aren't comfortable in a noisy environment cant express themselves in class,but if you take classes online you get to express yourself for example video confrence you get to express yourself and ask good question with good explanation. Because everybody has a way of learning some students adapt quick and others learn slowly,but taking this one on one course helps you adapt really quick because you are alone in a quite environment which is going to help you adapt really quick! Online classes also helps because some students have a hard time waking up early in the morning to school which causes you to be late everytime,being late can lead you to detention,saturday school and other things. But with this online course you can take it anytime during the day. Mainly my point is online classes are very helpful and it helps students to concentrate more.

Some students would disagree to take classes online because some people have a fast away of adapting. Some students like to interact with others,students like to experience the high school life.

Do you think would benefit from being able to attend classes from home? It all depends on the ways the student learns.
