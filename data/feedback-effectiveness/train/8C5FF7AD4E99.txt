Dear principal,

I think every student should be required to perform community service. The reason why students should be required to perform community service is that it helps out the environment. Some of the students might like helping out the environment. I know it would be fun to help out the environment. It would be fun because students will get out of class.

There are many ways to perform community service. The first way the students can help out the environment is picking up trash, recycle cans, papers, and plastic. The second way to perform community service is that you can tutor kids for 2 hours a week. The third way you can perform community service is that you can do a job. The fourth way is to help make some stuff for the school. Those are my ways to you can do to help out.

Those are my ways to perform community service. I don't think it should be hard community service. If it was hard community service the students couldn't not get the work done. That is why I think students should be required to perform community service.

serenely, STUDENT_NAME
