Venus one of the hottest place I wouldn't recomand going there too study, it's too dangerous to go study at venus , you could get stuck there or something. The planet surface temperatures is over 800 degrees Fahrenheit and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what our own planet. The percent of carbon dioxide is 97 percent. People study about venus, how is and how hot it is and if there is people/animals living there, but they know it's not easy conditions but servivable for humans.

Comparison systems that use mechanical parts can be made more resistant to pressure, heat, and other forces. Exploring venus is dangorus because if NASA is planning someone too venus wouldn't be a good idea is better sending them in a group but sending someone alone is not a good idea. Venus is the closest planet to Earth terms of density and size and occasionally the closet in distance too. Earth, Venus, and Mars and the other planetary neighbor orbit the sun at different speeds. The differences in speed mean that sometimes we are closer to mars and other times to venus.

Numerous factors contribute to Venus's reputation as a challenging planet for humans to study , despite it's proximity to us.
