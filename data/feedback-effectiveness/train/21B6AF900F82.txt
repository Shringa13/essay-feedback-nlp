The author believes Venus is a worthy pursuit depite the dangers. There is lots of evidence to support the authors claim. I personally agree with the author that we should look into Venus more.

Venus could be suitable for humans. The author shows this by telling "temperatures would still be toasty at around 170 degrees Fahrenheit, but the air pressure would be close to sea level on Earth. Solar power would be plentiful, and radiation would not exceed Earth levels. Not easy condiotions but survivalbe for humans." Venus can be suitable for humans, it just would be very difficult starting off. Soon enough humans would adapt to the hostile environment of Venus.

Venus could have to be humanities future if we keep polluting Earth. Venus could be suitable yet harsh, but still needs to be learned about a lot more. We still know only the bare minimum of Venus.

Venus is very hostile. Humans would not be able to survive on an atmosphere that is 97 percent carbon dioxide. It's clouds are highly corrosive with sulfuric acid, and temperatures are averaged over 800 degrees Fahrenheit. It would take a very great amount of effort to make Venus a new home. But if it is studied more we may be able to make it a place to stay.

Overrall I think it would be smart to learn more about Venus. It could potentially be a new home. Venus seems to be almost as promising as Mars does right now, but still we need lots of information. The author had very good claims, and I agree with them. If we put more into studying Venus I believe it would help humanity.
