dear principle,

I believe that we do not need to require that all students perform community service. I believe that students that enjoy or want to perform community service may do as they like or choose. Some of the students believe that it should not be available at all but i personally believe that it should be for those who want to. It does take a long time out of the day but also it helps the community all together because that's what it is. Other students like many of my friends, believe that it takes up too much of their time to do activities with their friends and they want it gone all together. so really there is three sides to this but I am writing this letter to tell you that my opinion is that we should have it for those who would like to participate in the activity. And we do not need to get rid of it all together.

Thank you for reading this letter.

Your friend and student STUDENT_NAME.
