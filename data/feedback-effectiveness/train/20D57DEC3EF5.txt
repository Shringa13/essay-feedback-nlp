I think using a Facial Action Coding Systemin the classroom to identify the emotions of students is not okay, Why? becuase some people want to express themselves of their feelings that has been done by others. But not such that. In fact, we humans perform this same impressive "calculation" everday. For instance you can probably tell if a friend is feeling simply emotion by looking at thair face. But for some people painting portraits can help them express their feelings through painting. Sometimes people express their emotions through music by singing or making music. Then in the Mona Lisa, no one knows what feeling she is expressing and what is she feeling. For instance, some artists say she is happy but no one really knows what emotion she is feeling. In conclusion, I think classrooms shouldn't use Facial Action Coding System to identify the expression of students an how they are feeling. But some people have hidden talents that they use to express themselves or their emotions. Also not many people icluding students express themselves through painting some use dancing, acting, making music, singing, cooking and their are many ways of expressing your emotions through many things. For instance people express themselves through writing books, but many people can understand their feelings that by reading their life as a book.
