I believe that it would be better to allow students to have their cell phones out during lunch or free time because many teenagers think that their cell phone is an extension of their body or something that they need and can not live without. If you let the students have their cell phones out during lunch or free time there would be less problems with someone texting in class.

I think that the reason people are so dependent of their cell phones is because it is a quick and easy way to talk to their friends.

I think if you do not let them have their cell phones there would be more problems with them texting or calling people in class because as teenagers we do not like being told what not to do or what to do.

So I believe that if you let them use their phones during lunch time or free time but not during class would be a better solution then taking their phones away completely.

granted a cell phone can be very useful during an emergency situation but not during the time your supposed to learn.

But there are some drawbacks to allowing students to have their phones is that they may think that it is ok to use their phone during class. so i believe that it would be best to put the student's name on the phone and place it in a bin in front of the class so you can know that the student is not texting or calling any one in class while the teacher is talking and you can see to it that they get their phone back after class.

That is why i believe that it would be wise to allow students to have their phones turned on during lunch or free time as long as the student has the cell phone turned off during class.
