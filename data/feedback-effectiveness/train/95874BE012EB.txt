The planet, Cydonia was discoved to have a face-shaped figure that stretched two miles long! Although some people believe that alien-life or some life-form has occurred or is still occurring to this day. I believe that the face figure is just another natural formed landmass like several we have on earth. For instance the Middle Butte found in the Snake River Plain of Idaho has a lava dome which takes form of a messa.

In paragraph eleven of "Unmasking the Face on Mars", Garvin says, "As a thumbs rule, you can discern things in a digital image three times bigger then the pixel size, So, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what there were!" This explains that there is no way of showing or providing any evidence of aliens or lifeform on Mars.

The author also mentions that Garvin says, "It;s not easy to target Cydonia. In fact, it's hard work." In this paragraph nine it also consentrates about the angle it is looked apon. I feel like if it was hard to find the perfect angle and measurements to take a closer look at the face, there could have been mistakes made without realization.

Even though no one knows whether or not if there was or life on Mars or if there still is. The likelyhood of this theory is very low. There would have to be a water supply, nutrients to feed off of, sunlight, shelter, etc. for any living organisms to survive.

Everyone should be allowed to have their own beliefs, but sometimes people believe in things that are hardly believeable. This could help save time and convience for in the future whenever NASA finds solid evidence that there is no evidence of aliens on planet Mars. Even if NASA would like the fundings for finding existance of lifeform, it would also be a great discovery that there isn't because they could narrow the list of safe planets us ,humans, could live on if there was any kind of diaster to happen to our planet.
