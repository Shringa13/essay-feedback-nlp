The selctions I just read contain one common subject:people drive less cars now in the first and second selection both talk about how some neighborhoods ban the use of cars on certian or all days. In the first selection In german suburb, life goes on without cars the author Elisabeth Rosenthal states " 70 percent of Vauban's families do not own cars, and 57 percent sold a car to move there." In other words they either had a car but sold it to move or they never had a car to begin with.

In selection 2, it talks about how people are not evven allowed to drive cars on certain days of the week. In paragraph 2 the authour says "On Monday motorists with even numbered license plates are ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22-euro fine."

The final 2 selections discuss how studies show that people in America are driving less and less as time passes by. In my opionion I think we shoud do whatever we think is right.
