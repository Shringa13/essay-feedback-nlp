I think that this is pretty cool to be able to read for face experssions. Like you can tell if someones happy or mad by a computer just reading your face. It can tell because how your cheek bone and moves one way and they can tell your emotions. Its crazy too how fare we came to be able to have a computer be able to tell if your mad or sad or any emoetions you have. So I think its a good idea to have to something that able to do something like this.

I think this is a cool thing that your able to do like how they knew Mona Lisas emetions. How she was "83 percent happy, 9 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry". There will still be people like how they are in paragraph 2. "How can a computer recognize the subtle facial movement we humans use to express how we feel?". I think alot of people will like it because its something so cool and new and everyone would want to go try it out and go buy one to do it. "The faical exoressions for each emotion are universal.

Its something thats really cool alot of people and little kids would like it. Everyone would want to try and see what their emotions say. So if they did come out with something like this alot of them would sell quick and i know they wont be cheap. We have came so fare from having to wait 5 minutes to take a picture to now being able to tell a persons emotions by a computer just reading there face.
