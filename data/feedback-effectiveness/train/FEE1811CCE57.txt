Luke made nine trips and was brave to make that choice. But lukes friend decided to invite luke on this trip so luke was pretty glad that his friend invited him. then luke and his friend were asked to take care of horses,young cows,and mules.

Luke then decided to take his traveling a whole new level especially on return trips after the animals had been unloaded. Luke decided to play games on board like basball,volleyball,table tennis he was also fencing,boxing,reading,and whittling. well being a seagoing cowboy was much more than an adventure for luke bomberger. Luke had so much fun being a seagoing cowboy. and leading his family hosts a number of international students and exchange vistors for many and many years so when people bring up seagoing cowboys they can remenber that it is a jorney. The lesson in this story is that "you never know whats going to happen if you take a risk".
