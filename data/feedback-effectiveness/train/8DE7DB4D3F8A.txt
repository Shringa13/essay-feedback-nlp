Many uncommon things happen causing people to be very fascinated with a certain subject. Any time something to do with space occurs, many people freak out or become fascinated with the subject. When something to do with space does occur, then usually people believe alien life forms. But with a cleaner and better camera the photos revealed that it was a natural landform and not an alien monument after all.

With an even better camera lense than before the picture is still proof that shows it is a normal, typical landform. Even with small objects you would still be able to clearly see if the object is a landform or a alien life form. The natural landform is equivalent to a butte or mesa. The "face" on Mars is still a like to a normal landform on Earth.

The form can not be life like or be alien like due to the amount of information and facts that NASA has to back up its ideas. The conspiracy theorists don't have as many facts as NASA to back up their information and ideas. NASA has majority of the information and facts which over rules the conspiracy theorists information and facts.
