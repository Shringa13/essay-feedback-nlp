I am in favor of changing the process in which America votes for its president;currently the when you cast your vote you are acctually voting for your candidate's electors whos votes do not become valid until [they] the electors are voted for by the [you] the people. A few problems with this process is expressed in an artical titled "

The Indefensible Electoral Colledge"

. With useing this process citizens sometimes do not have control over who their electors vote for, also voters may get confused and vote for the wrong candidate.

I can understand why other people may think my claim is wrong, but everyone is entitled to their own opinion, and should also be entitled to their own vote aswell which is why instead of voteing for someone who will vote for our president [

we

] the people should directly vote for our candidates. In the same article"

The Indfensible Electoral Colledge"

It states "Back in 1960, segergationists in the louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replaceing the democratic electors with new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy". They did this as an attemp to take the popular vote from kennedy. This just shows how much freedom the electors have with your vote.
