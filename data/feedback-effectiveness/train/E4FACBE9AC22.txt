Are principle has decided to make all students participate in at least one extracurricular activity. I think students should not have to do a extra activity because some kids have other things to do. And i think it should be a praivlage to do a extra class because some kids dont get good grades, or they just dont want to. I think if you are failing a class you should focus on that grade and bringing it up and getting it to at least a C or B . I also think that kids that get in trouble shouldnt be allowed to because they didnt listen or did something they wasnt suppose to . Why give a kid this if they dont listen, they dont deserve to do something like this is they are being disrespectful or not listening. Students that do get good grades above a

D ad F and arent disrespectful should be able to do this if they wanted to. The principle should let the kids decide if they want to participate in sports,work on the year book, or serve student council. If students some students did this and some students didnt do this it would be easier on the teacher in that class because schools have a lot of kids, and if you was to split the whole school up into activities there is going to be 1 teacher and a lot of kids. Now yes you can put more than 1 teacher in the rooms but if you think about it teachers have to plan there classes and what they are going to do for the rest of the week , and some teachers dont have time because they have other things they need to do after school and in school. Like what if a teacher got sick the other teacher would be by its self with all those kids . Some kids should do this because they never have or never had experience with this type of stuff and some kids will try and take advantage to this and only do it to get out of doing other stuff, thats why i think this is not a good idea ,
