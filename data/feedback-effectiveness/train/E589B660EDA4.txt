Dear Principal,

I think you should require all students to perform community service because many students laze around with nothing to do, when they could be helping the community. Many kids who are bored tend to get caught up in bad things , such as gangs, drugs, and violence. In requiring kids to perform community service, you are preventing them from doing bad things, you are giving them something to do after school , and you are helping them help the community.

I walk around my community to see kids fighting, doing drugs, stealing, and other bad things. If they had something positive to do after school and on the weekends , they'll be less likely to get into bad things. They might find that they like doing community service. So if more kids are required to do community service, they'll stay away from bad things.

Many kids are bored after school , with nothing to do , no friends to play with, so they sit around and get fat and lazy. If there were something for them to do after school, such as volunteer work, they'll be more prone to go out and make some new friends. They might become more open and confident.

And lastly , you were to require kids to do community service, you'd be helping them give back to the community. They could make the community a better place, by cleaning up trash , and helping the community stay a nice, safe, and clean place.

So , I think you should require kids to perform community service, because it would be good for them AND the community.
