The author of "The Challenge of Exploring Venus" definitely uses a lot of big words to describe the difficulties and other details of venus in general, but do they know what they are talking about? By carefully examining the text and pondering their ideas of the planets surface and difficuties of gaining access to venus , one could definitely say that yes, the author does support their idea very well. But this is a planet that can crush submarines like soda cans.

The author does prove some interesting points about the planets terrain and how we could work to develop technology for it. The author supports their ideas about the planet in a way that is hard for me to make an argument over, and uses information that is soid to the point where you don't want to try fact checking them. While they use counter arguments to violent conditions on the surface of the foreign planet, such as the idea of solar energy to use the powerful radiation. The author definitely knows what they are talking about, and sounds like they have some experience in debate.

The author claims that the limits of these terrifying endeavors should not be limited by the planets harsh conditions. The author also claims that the planet is hot enough to melt most types of metal. Those two statements counter each other due to the question of how we would get a material that can't melt in order to build safety equipment. While the author has some things that need explained more in depth, they definitely know how to prove a point.
