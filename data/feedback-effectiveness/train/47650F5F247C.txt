Dear principal,

It is unfair to not allow students to participate in after school activities if the student doesn't get at least a B average.

This completely unfair to students because after school activities allow students to express themselves outside school.

Students are unable to express themselves in the classroom, but after school activities really allow students to be themselves.

It is unfair that school can dictate how a student chooses to express themselves.

Not having after school activities can also affect the student's grades because after school activities can relieve stress with schoolwork, but if that student is unable to have after school activities, and just schoolwork to think about, they would be more stressful with school and it could really affect their focus.

This then could affect the students grades.

A students grade could get even worse without after school activities.

A student's schoolwork, and social life should be kept individually.

After school activities is a great chance for students to relieve stress with schoolwork, and let students to do something outside of school that they really enjoy doing.

Students shouldn't have to focus on school all the time because other activities are just as important in helping a student grow.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
