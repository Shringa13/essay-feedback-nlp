Dear State Senator,

I think that we should get rid of the eletoral collage and switch to a popular vote system because with the popular vote we can get the president we want if more people vote for the same one. Its fair if you vote for one preisdent but lose the election because more people voted for the other president, but its not fair if more people vote for the same president and still lose due to the eletoral collage

Now the eletoral collage is good for keeping track of votes but now most of the voting nowadays most of the voting is done off an eletronic device of some sort. Its not fair that almost all of the states' eletoral collages are winner-take-all. so its like turning the votes around and voting for the other person when you didn't.

Thank you for taking the time to read this and I hope to see the rules changing real soon.

Sincearly, PROPER_NAME.
