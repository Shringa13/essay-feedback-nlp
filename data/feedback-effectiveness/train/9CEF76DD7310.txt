Dear Principal,

I think that raising the required grade for sports from a C to a B will inspire students to work harder for their grades and since they won't be distracted by sports it will be much more achievable. The most important thing in school is to learn so you can one day hopefully go to college. I don't think sports would help but they allow you to get involved in your school itself. I'm not bashing on sports but as far as priorities go your making the right decision in raising the bar. I think this may be difficult for some students so you should offer some sort of help to get them on track. You could offer an after school study hall or even have other students tutor them. Anything that could help get them going would be great. I'm in sports myself and i love them and can tell you if I was prohibited from them because of my grades I would immediately try to find help or work as hard as i could to bring them back up. Again, I think that if they can't try in school they should' t be allowed to try in sports. If they aren't getting bad grades from lack of trying though that where the help should be offered. I just think that sports are important too and if they bring their grade up they can enjoy sports and grades all the more.

From,

Your student
