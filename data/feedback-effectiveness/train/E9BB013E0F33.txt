Gravin states that it reminds her\him of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. I think that by reading this passage and knowing a litte bit about it before it is just a natural landform not created by aliens. Aliens are not even real. People just think they are real.

I think it is a natural landform because not even humans could make something that looks just like a persons head that good. It might be from the Earths winds pushing the sand over and making it look like it a face. It also could be the gravitation pull of the Earth. I think that you should believe that is not aliens because if it was aliens dont you thinl they would be doing more than just that? That means if it reall the aliens who made this they must have a lot of thinking and knowledge about stuff like that. That also means that when earth moves the face moves with the Earth. Does this have anything to do with the man in the moon?

People probably think that it is made by aliens because people don't go to Mars. People that go to Mars have to be very brave and other things too. the camera has taken pictures because it has to have proof that it really does look like a face. I think again that it is just a landform that has been made over the pass years by the gratational pull and Earths winds.
