The electoral college method is a process that consists of the selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for the President and the Vice president, and the counting of the electoral votes by Congress. This means that that people are not directly voting for who they want to be president but voting for an elector that then places a vote. The founding fathers established it in the Constitution as a comprimise between election of the president by a vote in Congress and election of the president by a popular vote of qualified citizens. The Electoral College consists of 538 electors, and a majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the president.

But the other process of voting for a president is what we have now, it is called the popular vote, in which people go to a place where there are machines that you can place your vote for the president you want elected, the person with the most votes becomes the president of the United States and the person that lost the popular vote is elected vice president.

You may ask, well what is wrong with the Electoral College system? Well under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president. Some people are very serious about their choice of the president they take their time to learn what the president could do for them and their state and country. So when that much time is put in to making that vote people would get mad if a person with an entirely different idea just takes their vote and places it wherever they want.

The Electoral College is widely regarded as an anachronism, a non-democratic mothod of selcting a president that should be overruled by declaring the candidate who receives the most popular votes the winner. Since the electoral college is so old I think it is time to ebolish it!
