Technolgy to read the emotional expressions of students in the class room is not valuable because in paragraph 2 it says " how can a computer recognize the subtle facial movements we humans use to express how we feel " Why would we let a computer decide the way we feel when we already know how we feel ? The Mona Lisa was made to not show any emotions so why add emotions to the picture . Also in paragraph one its says " Dr. Huang and his colleague are experts at developing better ways for humans and computers to comminicate "

I feel as if we depend on technology to much and technology is taking over the world .

For example in paragraph 6 it says " A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored" Dr. Huang predicts . "Then it could modify the lesson , like an effective human instructor ." That is what the teacher is here for to modify the lesson if the student does not understand the assignment . Why let a computer take over ?
