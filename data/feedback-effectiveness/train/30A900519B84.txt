The Facial Action coding system enable computers to identify humans emotions. Dr. Huang relies the work of psychologists such as Dr. Paul Eckman, creator of FACS, Eckman has classified about six basic emotions which are happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and even sadness after that he even then associated each with characteristic movements of the facial muscles in which for example, are frontalis pars laterlis muscle (above your eyes) in the raises of are eyebrows when we are surprised; are orbicularis oris (around are mouth) tighten are lips to show anger.

The Mona Lisa demonstration is really intended to bring a smile to are face, while in the computer it shows it in how much it can do. In the computer imagine know when we are happy or even sad for example, if we smile when a Wed ad appears on are screen, a similar ad might follow. But if we frown, the next ad will be different.

When we are looking in the mirror:

* raise your lips at the corner of your mouth,

* when you squint your eyes slightly, to produce wrinkling at the corner of your eyes,

* when you hold it, rise the outer pars of your cheek up, toward your eyes,

In fact, these are instructionws for a face that looks happy.

In a real smile, the zygomatic major (muscles that begin at yourt cheek bones) lifts the corner of you mouth. (that's out instruction #1.)

Meanwhile, muscles called orbicularis oculi pars palpabraeus make crow's-feet around your eyes. But in a false smile, the mouth is stretched sidways using the zygomstic major and a different muscle, the risorius.

Theoty of Emotion, Moving are facial muscles not only expresses emotions, but also may even help produce them, in what you are feeling that day and how you felt last night, you show emotion at school, work, even at your own house. Emotion are express in how your day was, your emotions is like a tv show in how but act you fell what they feel if they are happy, mad, sad, or even scard.
