Dear State Senator,

I think we should keep the way we elect our President because we have for been doing this for so long this why would we change it if it's already perfect? And mostly because if we were to change it then the most of the former US Presidents would'nt even be President because of there rivals? actually had most votes, for instance in the 2000 U.S. President race , Al Gore received more individual votes then George W. Bush nationwide, but Bush won the election, receiving 271 electoral votes to Gore's 266, so you see? Bush was'nt the best but he was the closest thing to it, imagine how the U.S.  would be if someone else was President before. Would it be the same? Better? Worse? We will never know because we cant see things that never happened. And isnt the Electoral College a lot eaiser then an election by the popluar vote? So why change it now? We have been doing it this way for over 50 years and we never had a mistake, well not a big one at the very least.
