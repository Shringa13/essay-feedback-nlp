The conditions on venus aren't pretty. The tempertures get up to 800 degress fahrenheit. Humans can barely deal when it's a 100 degrees in Arizona. The carobon dioxide is so strong that we could survive it more than 10 minutes. Venus's surface tempertures are too hot to even walk on. Venus even has very dangerous weather like erruptng volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lighting strikes to proes seekng to land on it's surface.

Where could we go if earth was to blow up? Mars. Venus or Mercury, We don't have a for sure answer to that. Exploring Venus isn't a bad idea but very risky. We could see what Venus has that could benefit ot affect Earth. Considering Earth is the closet planet to Earth. NASA could potentially send robots in the spacecraft to see what information they can give.

No ones life should have to be put on the line to explore a diffrent planet. I personally think its a great idea. As said in the passage "Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation."
