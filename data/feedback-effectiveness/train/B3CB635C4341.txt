The face that loos like an alien could be a alien. We don't know as a team because nobody had not unburried it yet. They discover these faces on a red planet that is know as "Mars". There could be more aliens on that planet but we don't know. Its not a landform. A landform is a man made. A face is not naturally made into a plant nor ground. We as a team don't know what it is. Others say its land form, and others say it looks like an alien's face. Either one is wrong nor right. If I were to see it myself then I would say it looks like an alien's face. If there was some type of other evdience then thats when we know what it is. One clue isnt gonna help as much, unless we were to have more edvidence/ clues. I support my answer and said what I thought was a right/ good enough answer for all the team and people to understand.
