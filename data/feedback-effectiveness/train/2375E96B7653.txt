Dear TEACHER_NAME, I think that my school and I should be required to do community service. I also think it should be a choice for students to say whether or not they want to do it, like putting out a flyer or asking if they would like to help clean it up or something to that nature. The reason i think this way is because some students i know, including me does litter and don't think nothing of it, and its not a good thing. but then again we are 8th grade students and yes we know right from wrong but some students don't mature like others. And I know a lot of people that wouldn't help. But if u asked me I would be more than happy to help pick up around the community. Sometimes I pick up things and my friends ask me why I'm doing it, and it kind of offends me but i just roll with the roll. So that might be an reason why some students don't want to help out, because they think it is uncool or their to cool to be picking up litter after others. And i can come up with many more reasons why some student wouldn't help. But i have to stay positive. Well i do think that student should be required to pick up litter around the community, but my thinking has a limit.
