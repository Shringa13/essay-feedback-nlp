The technology used in the article shouldn't be used to read students emotional expressions. They shouldn't because if a student is very sad or upset even angry you'll want to know why and probably ask them why they feel that way.

Some students might want to talk about it, but most probably wouldn't so it might make them even more upset or angry and sad if you ask whats wrong and they dont want to talk about it. Also if it a personal issue the student is having and they tell you what's wrong and you can't help them they might feel like they're doing something wrong and get sad or depressed becasue you can't help them. Also if this was used to read the emotinal expressions of students in the classroom I feel like it would be a distraction and take time out of the students learing to figure out how every student is feeling based on the facial expressions. Another thing could be what of the technology making this possible is wrong, so you walk up to a student and ask them why they're so happy but they are actually really sad. What if the student just changes their apperance to make them look a different way when they are read for their emotion. The last thing is what are the teachers going to do with the imfomation on how they think their students are feeling based on a facial expression. Maybe in a college where you want to be a consuler or something along those lines it would be a good thing to have to teach you how to read others emotions better, but it would be useless in a middle or high school classroom and just cause distractions.

This shows why I dont think the technology would be good in the classroom. Becasue the technology could be wrong. Students could change their apparence to seem a different way. And it's useless to the teachers to have this information.
