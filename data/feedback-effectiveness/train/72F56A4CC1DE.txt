Dear State Senator,

I am writing this letter to you today to talk to you about Electoral College and election by popular vote. I feel very strongly on this topic as it is something I  know I  will come in contact with when i have the right to vote in the near future.

As we look back to the very day the Constitution was written, it has been a comprise that between election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizen that fifve hundred and thirty eight electorshave a meeting for they vote for President and Vice President, and the counting of the electoral votes by Congress, as stated by the Office of the Federal Register.

I strongly feel that we should change from Electoral College to election by popular vote. The reason I am saying this is because, it allows voters to equally vote for their rightful choice of president in that they feel best about having rule over the country.

Why is populary voting a better choice may many ask, popular voting is a better choice because it allows voters to have fair chance of having their choice of President, become Presidnt.

In the eyes of some, one in particular being Richard A. Posner, Electoral College may be good for a few reasons, those reasons being, Certainty of Outcome, Everyone's President, Swing States, Big States, and avoid Run-Off Elections but, in the eyes of others, it may seem "Unfair, outdated and irrational." Says Bradford Plumer.

In some cases, Electoral College may be an easier way to go for, the desired President to get elected but, not exactly the fairest way either. I believe that everyone should have a fair chance at voting and waiting for the out come equally with everyone and thats why I believe be we should change to election by popular vote.

Thank you.
