Imagine its a new school year and your principal his gone on the annulment to say that he his decided that all students must participate in one extracurricular activity like sports baseball,football, work on the year book, or do a book club. Some people might be mad look upset because they donÃÂ´t feel like choosing one but am cool with it. I agree about must participate in one extracurricular activity because I can make newer friends or the new comer can make new friends easier and it give us some thing to do while we wait until our parents comes home.

First, sometime it is hard to make new friends you at i new school and nobody knows you and u feel alone. Your parents or teacher might say say hi and you might mike a new friend that half a lie to me it easier said then done. Now you donÃÂ´t know how people will react to a samples hi,hello,or sup they might give you a a sink face or a nasty face but having some activity you can make some that like to do the same activity you like to do .yall might make a brotherhood or a sisterhood that can happen with this.

Second, I know sometime our parents have to work like a hour later or something. Having these activity give them time to go home and do what they got to do I know most of those activity ends at five or six and sports ends at seven sometimes. That give to time to make dinner or whatever go home eat do homework go to sleep or chill easy as that.

In conclusion having these activity help our parents and it help us that why I have agree with the resins that every student must participate in one extracurricular activity because it help us make new friends i believe it will make it easier and give our parents enough time to get off of work and do what they got to do.
