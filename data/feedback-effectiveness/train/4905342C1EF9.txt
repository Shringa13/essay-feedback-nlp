The argument of keeping The Electoral College is a big argument because the federal goverment is trying to take the electoral college out . I think that they should keep the electoral college because they are many electors that vote for president and they alsio vote for canidates, so theres no reason they should take out the electoral college. One reason they should take down the electoral college is to same money because some of the goverments moneyÂ  goes to that college that they dont pay for. for all these reasons i thinki they shoudnt take down the college, because where would the votes from the electors go.

When they heard that the wanted to take down the college all of the electors were kind of furious because the electoral college is where they go to vote for presidents and vote for canidates. Another reason is that the electoral college is taking too much money for the goverments votes , i Conclusion for these reason the goverment want to take down the electoral college for the electors.
