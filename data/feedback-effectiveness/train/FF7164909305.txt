I think we should use that technology to see students emotions. we would be abel to see how they really feel in that just one picture. we could see how they felt towards someone. when they lying too, becuase some students dont like to show or describe how they feel. not just on students we should use it on we should use it on friends and family too. we need to know how to help people if they upstet to cheer them up, or if there happy we need to know what made them happy.

some students/people dont like to express their emotions becuase they think it lame. especially men becuase they dont want to seem weak. everyone should know how they feel that day or how the felt becuase we might be able to help them. it can also see mixed emtions for example in the artical it said " the software can even identify mixed emtions". it saying we can see if they are feeling happy and mad or sad or mad together. it can identify what feelings are going in together.

it also very cool how just a computer can tell you the percentages of how somebody feels. like it awesome becuase you can maybe find out how somebody feels when they see you. it can let them know " oh he/she gets happy when they see me" and it might make them happy too. the crazy part of this invention he bulit is thta it parts they use for videogames. it can tell if your really feeling that way or just faking it. it can detect alot of emotions you might be hiding.
