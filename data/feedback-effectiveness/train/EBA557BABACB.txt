machine that reads smiles ,*sighs,''whats next"

in my opinon i do not think their should be a machine that could read my emotions ever i belive privacy is important and the will for someone to express their emotions to someone whom they may care about is sometimes sacred or personal varying on the person. technology that tracks the way our muscles move could be used for other puposes the machine can even track if were angry and how our lips tighten around our mouth ,this other ways we could use such as facial recongtion, best said himself " even though indiviuals showing varying degrees of expression" these could identify someones facial muscles even if they had face suregy or we could use this as machinery as facial reconstructions benifts .if its able to identify muscles of every unique person even famous art work like the mona lisa then this could have other benifts we could even look into the past to tell how historical figures were feeling in paintings or older photos. or we also could use to know animals emotions and how we can make an animal have a better day or stop animal related accidents from happening such as animal attacks. One good reason is if women could know if how we really felt about that dress the one they asked our opinons about then the trouble comes. often times emotions are the reflection of the human spirit emotions are things that leads rebilons agaimts broken systems or start movements,emotions are what gives us the extra inch for the push, emotions soemtimes give a door to grieve, our even hold our opinons , see we have feelings inside that no one should look threw in todays society alot of mans virutues once held have gone, emotions are something that is deep imside us that we can hold onto , humanity always wants to know even it breaks or passes the limit but , if emotions were able to show they could stop so much possibilties , imagine if slave masters knew their slaves emotions, or britian during the american revoultion knew, emotitons is how cover ourselves .
