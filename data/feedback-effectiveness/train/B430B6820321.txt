T

he state Senator of Florida, lets try and keep the electoral college. These are the facts that willmake want to vote against the popularity vote for presdency. The big states (large population count)of the United States will have an overruling vote against smaller states(lower count of population), some states big state will convince other states to get one of their senators to party up, and the disputes that will occure of the sharing of population vote.

O

ne of the first problem will occur is the large population states(California, Texas, and Florida, New York, Ohio, Pensilvannia)will have overruling vote on small population states. In source 3 paragraph 4 says,"Large states get more attention from presidential canidates in a campaign than a small state does." This means that large states ingulf all of the attention from smaller population states. Later will be a growing concern for the Electoral College.

A

nother problem eould be that large population states will convience smaller population state to help them in the vote for a presidentional race AKA swing states. This winner takes all voting style will effect the people of the swing state and the real verdict the people want or what s best for the state.

I n 2002 a dispute rang out over the winning canidate's share of the Electoral invariety rexceeded his share of the populariy vote. It is impossible to get a tie in Electoral college ,so you will always find who will president. One problem would be the landslide that will occur rarely.

T

hese would be major problems that will occur and it will be delt with of the populariity vote for presideny and how Electoral college should be kept in the United states Goverment.
