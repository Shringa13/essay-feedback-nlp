So many of us like to ask a variety of people for help when we are faced with a dilemma, and by doing so we give ourselves the best chance of picking the best option for us. We gain many advantages by doing this, compared to if we relied only on our own knowledge.

When we ask a variety of people for their opinion on a matter, we get many different solutions to solve a problem. We can then compare each of the positive and negative side effects of every option, and find which solution best fits us and our needs. Another advantage to getting numerous inputs on a topic is that we can then refine a majority of the bias out, and make the best choice according to the facts.

As a quarterback for my football team, I am in constant need of improvement on my skills to further our chances of success. I always ask my coach on what he thinks I need to improve on. He always gives me his feedback, and a way he thinks I could improve on that problem. Sometimes his advice doesn't completely fix the issue, so I go to my parents for help. My parents know my strengths and weaknesses, and help my to fix the problem tailoring my coach's advise to me. This gives me an option that not only works, but fits me as a person.

I ask many people for advise to find the best solution possible, because when I get a group of opinions from everyone, I can use them to build off of each other. By doing this, I can build a stronger opinion that goes more in depth, and fits my needs like a glove.
