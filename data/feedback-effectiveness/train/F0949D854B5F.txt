Dear State Senator,

I firmly belive that the electoral college is no longer applicible in todays political world. There have been a number of occations in the past were the electoral college has failed. For example in 2000, al gore won the popular vote, but lost the presedency. If we live in a deomcorcy the people should be the wons deciding our leader and in this case they did not. The electoral college must be fixed or exsponged imediatley.

The electoral college is unfair to voters. The cannidates can take advantage of a states population by only campaining in the states that "matter" to them. The president should not be determined by a couple people here and a couble people there. It should be determined by everybody that lives in america. Not a individual state.

The biggest problem here is that we (america) are so much more advanced then the system we have right now. Over 200 years later and were still using the same system. There is so much more room for improvment but that is not happening. The advances weve made in so many aspects of goverment are not being translated into the electoral college. Its time for a change in our favor.

In conclusion, the entire electoral college needs some major renovations. I ask for the issue to be reconzied and for a change to happen. I thank you for lisening to my opinion.

Farewell
