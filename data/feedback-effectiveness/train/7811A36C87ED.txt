Dear Principal

I thing that no matter what student need to do they should help out in cleaning the world because it is out good to live in a nasty world. Many student around the world will always go out side and clean up if they have stuff to do they just wait and do it later they will rather clean up. If you want to live in a clean invirment then you will support me with this problem that I want to fix.

Like there are some places where they don't care how it looks around them and it doesn't look really good. If we could fix this by just say it to go away it would be cool but we cant we have to do something about it. And the solution is to get a group from every student from every school and clean up the nasty thing from the world. And if the student in the school have to do any thing they can wait and get done another time in the time when they finish the work they had to do. So support me and we will fix the world and make it look like it was just born.

Maybe the teachers and principals can help do some cleaning up to cause the student cant do al the work. And if they could that is not fair if they do cause they need to do some of they other stuff like practise for a sport or some thing that they need to get better at. So let get out and do the work and leave the world the cleanest posable cause i know that we can we have done better thing before.
