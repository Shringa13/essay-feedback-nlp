How would a person feel if they could drive places without actually driving? Seems insane, but as in the passage "Driverless Cars are Coming," it possibly could happen soon. People need to have driverless cars. Here are some reasons why.

First off, people need to have driverless cars because it is proven to be safe. As said in the passage, "Their cars have driven more than half a million times without a crash.." Over the past few years there has been over a billion car wrecks causing injuries or worse, death. Driverless cars can decrease the stiutation, and there will be safer roads.

Second, people need to have driverless because it is the next big thing! In the passage, they talk about how a google cofounder, Sergey Brin, evinsions a future with a public transportation system where fleets of driverless cars form a public-transport taxi system. How relieving would it be to go places, especially at night, without worrying about the next car to get wrecked? Some people say that such cars will fundamentally change the world, as said in paragraph 1.

Some people may think that driverless cars would not be safe at all, and may cause more wrecks. Little do they know, driverless cars have a lot of sensors, such as a soecial touch sensor that makes sure the driver keeps hold of the wheel. Driverless cars are not completely driverless, it will require human skills when needed, as said in paragraph 7. Driverless cars do not put people in danger.

In conclusion, people need to have driverless cars. It is safe, fun. and the next big thing. Although the driver may still have to drive, he/she do not have to drive the whole time, and will not have to worry so much. Are driverless cars the future? Or illegal? If a person is for driverless cars, they should speak up and be heard.
