Venus is called the "Evening Star" and it's one of the brightest points of lights in the night sky. Venus is the second planet from the sun. It has been often refered to as earth's twin. It's been over three decades since a spacecraft has touched down on Venus. The carbon dioxide level is at 97 percent, and their are clouds of highly corrsive sulfuric acid and the average temerature is 800 degrees in fehrenheit, and the atomospheric pressure is 90 times greater than our planets. This environment would crush a submarine even when its accustomed to diving in the deepest parts of our oceans. Venus also has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in the solar system even though Mercury is closer to the sun. And the weather presents errupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lighting strikes to probes seeking to land on it surface. Venus once was the most Earth-like planet in our solar sytem that could have supported various forms of life like Earth. NASA has a possible solution to allow humans to study Venus, they will have to where we could hover 30 miles above the landscape so it'd be at sea level and the temerture would be at 170 degrees fehreheit, it won't be easy conditions but they are survivable for humans. They will be limited from what they can see and get. Others are trying for a more simplified approach by making electronics out of silicon carbide, which can last 3 weeks in Venus's conditions. Another one is Mechanical Computers which goes back as far as the 1800s and then played an important role in the 1940's during World War II. They made calculations by using gears and levers and did not require electronics at all. Modern computers are powerful. flexible, and quick but they are more delicate while a system made out of mechanical parts can be made to be more resistant to pressure, heat, and other forces.
