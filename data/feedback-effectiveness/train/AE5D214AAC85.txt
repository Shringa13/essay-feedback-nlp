Dear Mr. Principal,

I think you should require community service to every kid in the school, Because we would be helping the environment and making our community a better place to live in.

One good reason why you should require is so we have a city that people could come and say "wow what a helpful city this is!" We would be helping the city look nice, not only that it would bring more people to wanting to come to our city and live here and our population would grow! our people say "Keep Austin Clean!" and if we can make every kid do community service to help clean the city, we could have and keep Austin the cleanest city in the United States.

Another good reason would be that we would be helping the environment, the animal shelters would be nice and the animals would be good and not suffer, the air won't be polluted, fishes won't be dyeing from people throwing things in the water, and it would make our environment safe for us and the wild animals that live in our city.

Another good reason that it would be good is that it would give us an advantage on our high school credits. we need the credits to pass high school, so why not start now and finish it before we graduate out of high school. in fact, in high school most of the kids get their credits by community service! so this would give us an advantage for next year and you would help us reach our goal to graduate in a few years.

I think you should require it, at least to the 8th graders, because we need to start taking more responsibility in everything we do, and we would be helping our city and the people and animals that live around us, and we would be helping the future people living in this city by keeping it clean for them.

this would be a wonderful task to put for us and i would commit to encouraging the other 8th graders to do community service and help our city's future and to help our environment now a days.

sincerely,
