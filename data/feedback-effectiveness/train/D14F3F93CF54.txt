Dear, principal

We should be aloud to participate in sporting events with a c average because being in sports helps kids express their feeling and their sprit of accomplishment. If you would take away sports kids will protest and will never be aloud in sports because they can only get a c average. We wont have a big team in anything because nobody can get a b average except a few kids and that will draw to an end in the school sports programs and then well never be able to play sports. We kids need time to express our selves in sports learn to get better at it and keep on trying to achieve our goals in life. By not letting kids play sports they will change school to a school that lets them play sports with a c average. Parents will argue cause their kid can't play the sport that he or she want to play cause they have a c average. I think that kids with a c average or higher could be able to play sports but kids with d or f averages should have to get their grades up and get help if they need help. When you change the rules kids wont go to this school or their parents will argue with you about the rule change. This is why you shouldn't change the rules at our school to a student need to have a b average or higher to play sports.
