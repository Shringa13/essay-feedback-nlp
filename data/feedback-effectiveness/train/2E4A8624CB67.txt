I think that the author has a good point her beacuse it teaches the reading that Mars is not the only chicos with this we get to see that ther is other chicos that we can pick if one day we have to leave plant earth. Venus is a instreting plant because its sometimes cloeser to us then mars and it can help understand how to take care of earth. With this we get to see what we can change and what. We dont need to change about our plant Earth and what we do need to chance. Earth is a good plant but Venus is a plant that we dont fully understand as most plants Venus is a plant that is new to the human kind.

What Venus have that we dont which is good that the envioment can cush a submarin and the conditions. That it might not let a human leave in Venus is dangerous. But can be really helpful like if its amosphere is so strange can take some samples and can use it to help the earth be more protective. It can help us understand why its like and if one day and see if some one can live up there. Vensu us the hottest sureface temperture in our whole solors system which is perrt col if you ask me its hooter then the summer on the earth because its cloers to the sun.

`I think that us as human need to study Venus close and see waht it really is can see if it can help us understand our plant more and more. We need to watch it closly to send people up there and see if tis right for humans. but yeah i think that Venus is a cool plant to study more cloly because its reaslly insterting to see how a differtn platn works everyday. We need to study it more so we cansee why its called the Evening Stare why its cloer to the sun why we need to talk about more to peepole so they may see how insterting is to study a plant like Venus.
