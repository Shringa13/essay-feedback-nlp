Dear, Principle

I do not think students should be required to perform community service.

Because students should only perform in any type of community service if they litter or damage any property.

This way it will teach the students that they shouldn't litter and that it is bad, and damages a lot of our property and if they do it they will have to pay for what they have done and suffer a big punishment. For example if someone throws a drink bottle on the ground it is there responsibility and they should clean it up.

Many students think that littering is a fun thing to do. Littering is a foul habit for a lot of people, most people don't realize how bad it damages our community and pollution. Many elementary schools think that cleaning up litter is very important so they take the time to help our community when they haven't done anything. So i think whoever litters should take the punishment of performing this type of action, and clean up our community.
