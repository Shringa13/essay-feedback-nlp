I belive my claim for or against the value of using this technology to read students emotional expressions are invading our private space. What i'm trying to say is what if they computer says the wrong things or if we feel something that could be embarrasing or offended it'll cause us to either become more emotional or angry/offended. I believe you will also be taking jobs of those who have went to college to major in this type of senarios. If you are taking all of this for people to have it on a computer software then you are no better than hispanics or immagrants taking people jobs because it'll lessen the chance of people even knowing or wanting to become in their life. Yes we need to advance technology to better help people but,people still have their rights and beliefs and you would be crossing the line in my opinion if you were to believe this idea. I say let the professionals handle it who are in some ways the same way cause the computers would be screening us humans when there are other professional humans to relate or more capable of helping someone than a software and if the system goes wrong then what will you guys do then? What i'm trying to say is just let people who can relate and have diplomas for this kind of stuff let them do their jobs and stop replacing humans with machines because it'll be another Great Depression coming to you.
