I feel the elctoral college is overpowered and isnt neccsary

Ifeel that the Electoral college is not a place its a process. The Founding fathers established it in the constitutional as a compromise between the election pf president by vote. See the elctoral college consists of 538 elctors. A majority of 270 elctoral votes is required.

To Begin,Each canidate running for president in your state has his or her own group of electors. these electors are generally chosen by the canidate's political, but as usaul state laws vary on how elcetors sare selected and what thier responsibilities are....

See the presidential election is held every four years on the tueday after novemvber, but what people dont know when you vote for canidates you are actually voting for your canidate's elcetors.

Most feel its "winner takes-all" system that awards all electors to the winning presidental canidate; but it's states like Maine and Nebraska each have a variation of "proprtional representation." After the presidential elction, your governor prepares a "Certificate of Ascertainment"Â  listing all of the canidates who ran for president in your state, as well as the names of their respective electors

Under the electoral college system voters not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president. The electors can be anyone not holding public office. the pickers of first place depends on the state, maybe even state conventions, all these things can help inprove the voting polls and make them quicker
