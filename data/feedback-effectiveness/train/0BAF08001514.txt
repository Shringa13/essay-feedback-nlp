Dear Principal,

I think Policy 1 would be a good idea "Allow students to bring phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times, as long as the phones are turned off during class". As long as the phones are off during calls then kids should be allowed to use then during lunch and floor time. Sense the rules changed and we are no longer allowed to go to the bathrooms we have to stay in class then we should be able to at least text and play games. I do not see why we are not allowed to use phones at floor. it really does not change anything except for the fact that it would keep most of us quiet. Half of the school brings there phones into class anyway. They text, go on face book, play games, some even talk on the phone. Most kids go to the bathroom to text and talk to people so I think that you should at least let people use there phones at floor. because that would probably stop most of them from texting during class if they can look forward to texting during floor and lunch time and other free times they have during school hours. I don`t see why people can not have phones during class. If something were to happen they could tell there parents what is going on or if they get in trouble they could text or call there parents to say "pick me up at this time because i have to stay after". This Is The Reason Why I Would Go With Policy 1.
