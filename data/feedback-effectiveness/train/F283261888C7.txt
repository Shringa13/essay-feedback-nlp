Dear senator,

Many say that the Electoral College so not be used anymore, but some will come back and argue that it should be used.

Many people dislike the Electoral College because the say it is unfair or irrational. The Electoral College is way different than popular vote. Popular votes are actually done by the people and they pick who they want for president, but the Electoral College is done by a person picking someone of their state's goverment and then leaves it to them to pick their president. Te electorial votes are unfair because it deoends on how big a state's population is. Some states only have 3

Electoral votes, but if that state used its popular votes it would

A LOT

more than just three votes to one president.

Many people on the other hand do like the Electoral College. They like the Electoral College because the stae will have voted and not leave it to the people to. In 2012 only about one-half of elgible voters did vote. The Electoral College is said to be the most effecient way of voting by some people. People like the Electoral College more than popular voting is because in popular voting you will have certain people ote for cerain people not the best candidate, but in Electoral voting the person has nothing to do with the outcame so there will be no arguing on whos fault it is.

The Electoral College

NEEDS

to stay. If we get rid of the Electoral College the amount of votes in popular voting would be low to determine who they should pick. The Electoal College is the biggest reason we do so well on presidental winners.

From,

The People
