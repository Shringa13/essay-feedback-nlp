Required Essay: Phones and Driving

The use of cell phones and other handheld devices make daily life in the 21st century easier and more convenient than it has ever been. However, attachment to these devices can distract individuals from their surroundings causing a number of problems. Mainly, using a cell phone while operating a vehicle has a great potential to cause accidents. Alternative hands free devices such as bluetooth headsets can keep a driver's eyes on the road while also being able to communicate as necessary.

If a driver is using their cell phone, it means that their visual focus has become divided and the potential for an accident is greatly increased. According to The United States Department of Transportation, cellphones are the cause of 1.6 million car crashes per year in the U.S. Driving a car requires a certain amount of focus, coordination, and reflexes in order to drive safely. Humans can only focus on so much at once, so unnecessary operation of a cellular device is highly advised against when doing something as potentially dangerous as driving.

Hands free accessories are the perfect alternative for people who absolutely need to be communicating while driving. Headsets and bluetooth screens integrated in to some cars are relatively safe compared to blatant texting while driving. While a study done by the University of Utah displays evidence that using these hands free devices can incapacitate a driver even more than alcohol, having a set of eyes on the road is still better than none at all.

When driving, the best way to avoid an accident is to not communicate via a cellular device in any way. Laws against using cell phones when driving should remain in place and continue to be enforced. Not only do they put the driver in danger, they put everyone else on the road in danger as well.
