I think this facial action codig system would be really helpfull to people who work on computers or students. comptuer work is boring and lame so i would want it to send me somethjing that makes me laugh or smile.

I think the facial acting coding system will be a good idea on life on this plane. t it could help out our students like it said in paragraph 6 it said the computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored. Then the computer could modify the lesson like an effective human instuctor. or when you get on anybody it could see your emotion and give you something that woukld help with it. it could make video games better and in paragraph 6 it says that

"most human communication is nonverbal including emotional communication so computers need to understand that to".

Then again some people would think that its weird to have a computer watching your face 24/7. ,aybe it could turn into a robot and take over the world. we would never know but if they did come out with the facial action coding system it would be kinda cool to have videos and stuff to cheer you up if your sad if your in a good mood could send you something to make you laugh. Even if your just doing homework and it could tell that your upset or confused or just bugged out by the problem it could help you without even asking fo9r help it would help you out right away i think thats coool cause alot of kids need help on stuff like that and for teachers they cant help alot of students with work. So before the teacher even gets to them the computer could be helping them alreadfy its like a teaher thats already there and lord knows every student wants that extra help to pass.
