Dear Senator,

I was recently was informed that the electrol collge system is going under. It helps use with our votes. If we lose it certain American citizens votes will not be counted in for the president election. I believe that we American citizens should be able to vote. Our votes should all matter. We as a nation are one. One vote we all should be able to vote.

To begin with,

We hold our next presidnet in our hands. Thats why we should change the election by popular votes. If everybody over the age of 21 votes all of our votes would be counted in and we would pick our president. We should also keep the electrol college so congress helps our nation to vote also. Because if we give this country over to the wrong president our country could fall and we could go under. One of the reasons that our country is still standing today is because we as a nation have pick a great president, without hessition. Back in the old days we didnt have a right to vote. We are blessed to be able to vote and a system like the electrol college today. If we lose the electrol college we lose hope and faith that our country we be still standing.

In conclusion,

We americans are sometimes not greatful for the things we have but without we are lost. Senator we need your help. Without the electrol citizen we lose hope on our country. Please let us down.
