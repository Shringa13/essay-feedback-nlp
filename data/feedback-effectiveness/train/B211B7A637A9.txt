Dear Principal,

Changing the school policy to only letting students attend or play sports is good but bad at the same time, it can be good because you should keep up with your school work while your playing sports or other activities. That is the main reason why you are going to school. If you cannot somehow keep up with any of your school work and your getting D' s and F' s then you shouldn't be playing any sports or be in any activities for the week or that period of time. But having as C average and not being able to play sports i think is unreasonable. So having that policy is a good thing. But it can be bad at a certain point because having to have at least a B average is kind of high. I think at least having a C average is pretty reasonable than having to have a B average. If the policy was having to have at least a B average to play any sports or other activities i wouldn't join any of them.
