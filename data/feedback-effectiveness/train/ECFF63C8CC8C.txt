The use of technology is not valuable when comes to reading emotions in classroom because even though we express ourselves so easily however those of us with ability manipulate others and or manipulate the technology it self like hacking or reprogrammming data based and operating systems of the computer which by the way is softer that completly allows the hardware and software talk to each other examples of operating systems is Microsoft's Windows 10 and Apple's Mac os X or as I call it Mac os 10 because X in roman numbers means 10 can be hacked by viruses and malware and worst of all ransomware itself and we all know for every key you bet their is always a lock and vice versa why do you think computer security specialist exist to work and counter each other for sake of technology. Also yes while emotions are mixed we may feel one emotion more than other when going through mixed emotions ok I get that truly but when you say oh this person is 83% this and 9% this how can you accuratley say that when emotions aren't calcuated by math no we humans are too complex for that that's why we have people taking care of people not robots caring for people why it's because where made to be complex. That is like saying that weather guy like oh well its gonna be 60% chance of rain and thunderstorm here in the mid east of country no no not it all all because the weather guy only gets stuff right 80%-90% of weather right shoot weather people struggle to predict indiana weather because one season supposed be harsh and deadly potentional winter right while we may have that but like one day it wants be 60 degress fariheit like no its not supposed be that warm in indiana in winter when we think winter we think snow, hail ,snow storms , chilly winds any type extreme colds but warmth no no not at all partly cloudy ok sure some sunshine with cold windchill sure but extreme odd warmth for time of winter no because these technologies that help us as people aren't always helping like there is always something wrong with technology because we made the technology and one characteristic we passed down to technology and that is inperfection in fact we intentionally made the technolgy to some degree less smarter than us so we can always have room inprove ourselves and you wouldn't want something made to be a tool be superior to you right of course you don't so why use technology to replace humans why not except some things we have and here the thing paragraph number two even says I am right because you cannot calculate emotions with math no as also talked in paragraph number 3 emotions are discovered when our muscles move certain way our body instinctively tells us to do so not fully instinctlively because our thoughts and nerves go so fast we sometimes in instant gratification stuff lose precious time to react when needed to and our nerves and speed of the nerves why we is limited by our very own fixed speed and thoughts and emotions and stuff. Also paragraph 4 says each facial expression is universal so even though we all have similar look when happy sad, angry , depresssed doesn't mean all angry and depressed people look same and we can hide or have our feelings mixed up with so much thoughts in our head that is happening.
