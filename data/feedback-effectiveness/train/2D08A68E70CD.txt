I think that the author describes how technolgoy called Facial Action Coding System enables computer to idntify human emotions and expressions of the students in the classroom are valuable. For example at the begging the line " imagine being able to detect exactly how other people are feeling, even when they are trying to hide their emotions." Catches people attention. Another example that the author used that was included that was good was in paragrah one when it states that "Shes 83 percent happy, 9percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry. This shows that the author included logos in his paragrah another way of having a valuable short.

Third example has pathos catching peoples feelings or making them think being put into someone els shoes."Hold on! can we actually "calculate"emotions-like math homework? and how can a computer recognize the subtle facial movements we humans use to express how we feel". The author also gave us examples of looking in the mirror. I think that the author gave details examples for the student to having in the classroom.
