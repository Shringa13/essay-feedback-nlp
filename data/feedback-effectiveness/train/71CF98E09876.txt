In the text it say's however peering at venus from a ship orbiting or hovering safety far above of the planet can provide only limited insights on the ground conditions becuase most forms of light can not penetrate the dese atmospher. Its's worth it to study and learen about venus beacuse you can see up close and learen about the forms of lights and the desenics atmosphere and standerd forms of photography and videography ineffective but there are risks like in anything you study or do in life there are risk's.
