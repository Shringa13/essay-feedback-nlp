Dear Principle,

I don't think that you should require every student to do community service.

I think this because everybody should be able to do what they want.

They could volunteer to do it, but you shouldn't make them do it.

It would be a good idea to start a little club or something of that sort to do community service.

Or you could put up a list in the office or right outside of the office for people to participate in doing community service.

I don't think everybody should have to do it cause when they are not in school some have things to do like sports and other sorts of clubs.

You could also get a class that people could be in to do community service as a class so people could put on job applications and college applications too.

A class would also be good for tutoring the elementary, so they wouldn't have to stay after school.

Most student probably wouldn't be able to do that.
