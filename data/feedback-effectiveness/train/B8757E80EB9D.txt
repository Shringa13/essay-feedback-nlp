Venus can be a scary planet when it comes down to its features. The writer to this story certanly convinced me that we should not study Venus anymore. We have tried to land spacecraft on the planet before, but none have last no more than a few hours, so how are we supposed to study it when it just keeps destroying our spacecrafts. We haven't tried it again in a decade. The reason to this is that Temperatures vary around 800 degrees fahrenheit. Venus has a thick atmosphere of 97% carbon dioxide. If us humans even take a step on Venus we get crushed. Venus has a 90% atomic pressure, which is greater than what we have on Earth. It could even crush a submarine and those are supposed to outstand pressure from the ocean. Venus isn't a very pretty planet either, it has a familiar features as valleys,mountains, and craters. We could use spacecraft to hover over venus about 30 miles or so above it. Even if we did that we couldn't take sample rocks or gas. Are technology gets better throughout the years, so maybe one day well figure a way out to oustand that heat and pressure. Even if we do that though, what would be the sense if we cant even live on the planet. Half of the stuff we use today will never outstand the heat or pressure that Venus has. Including phones,cars,and houses. This shows you that studying venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents.
