I think policy one is much better because sometimes there are days where you forget something or don't remember to bring something. If you had a cell phone then you could call or text your parents/guardians and ask them to bring it. Also if you have your cell phone on you instead of taking notes in class some cell phones have a camera and the ones with cameras could take a picture of their notes. If you need to find out what a word means you can just look it up on your phone. If you turn them off when they are supposed to be turned off then there are no problems. Also some people forget to bring lets say there gym clothes they could just call or text there parents and they could bring them. I see why people wouldn't want cell phones at school like they could be distractions but, if they are allowed at schools then students should have no reason to do it in class when they know they can do it at a free time in the day. there are plenty of reasons why kids should be able to use cell phones in school. One big reason we should have cell phones in school is they could be used for all kinds of things like say i am in social studies class and the teacher asks a question and nobody knows the answer then kids could get on there phones and look up the answer. Another reason would be that students rarely study, much less every night but, if they are allowed to use there cell phones then that makes studying easier and more fun.
