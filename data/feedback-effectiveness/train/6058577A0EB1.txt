Dear Mr or Mrs senator I think we should keep our method of choosing our state president. it more easier then any other method. Also it less time consuming.

College voting method is the most easiest method to use. All we have to do is vote and who ever gets the most votes win. I think its just a fair method to use. I feel like the other method is just to complex so we should stick to the college voting method. almost half of the time to president we choose is the right president for the US.

Another reason we should keep the college method is because it wouldnt take that long. All we really just have to do is vote and in no time our president will be in office.

in conclusion I think we should keep the college method because its less time consuming and its an easier process.
