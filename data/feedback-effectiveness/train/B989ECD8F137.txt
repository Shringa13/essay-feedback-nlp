I would argue in favor of changing to election by popular vote for the president of the united states and not keeping the ellectoral college. there are many reasons why i say that and will do that. some people might still want electoral college because of the certainity of outcome, everyones president, swing states, big states, and last but not least to avoid run-off elections.

in my opinion i think we should change the election by popular votes instead of ellectoral college, because we the people .. vote for who we think should be head or our state and who we think is going to be in charge and do they thiing and make our a state a better and safier place to live. We dont vote for electors  ... so many people can vote on one paticular person to be head of our state and president and the other person can only get 3 votes  but in ellectoral collage he/she can have more electoral votes and they win the election .. even tho the other canidate has more popular votes.

The other reason why i might want to change rhe election by popular votes instead of ellectoral college is becauise of the "disaster factor". Which the state legislature are responsible for picking electors..... and the electors would/could always defy the will of the poeple.

Those are the two main reasons why i would argue in favor of changing to election by popular vote for the president of united states and not keeping the ellectoral college.
