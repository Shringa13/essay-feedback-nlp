The author of this essay suggests that they definately know Venus and have done their research on this topic before. There is quite a bit of information in there to handle all at face value, percentages and dates gallore. Either way, I have come to the deduction that the author very much desires for scientests to explore Venus.

According to the essay, Venus is often refered to as eaths twin because ofit's similar size, density and occassionally the close distance to earth. Another fact is that They took the time to research Venus' atmosphere, which is 97% carbon dioxide blankets over the planet itself. It goes on to inform us about the weather systems and the environment Vus really holds behind those thick blankerts of gas. Another supporting claim for their research is that they go through the history of what we know about Venus and or speculate it was like. Thhey also talk about what the future could look like if we do intend to explore Venus.

IN conclusion, this author is extremely passionate about out 'twin' planet and it is very clear to see that theywish someone would go out there and explore.
