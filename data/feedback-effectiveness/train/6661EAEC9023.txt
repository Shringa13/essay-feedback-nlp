Dear Principal,

I strongly support policy 1, which allows students to bring and use their cell phones during school as long as they are turned off in class. Students have the right to use their cell phones during lunch and other free times. With applying this policy, students do not have to suffer to try and hide their cell phones during class. It is also good for the teachers, without this policy teachers may have to stop lessons and talk to other students trying to text in class.

With this policy, students have a free right to use cell phones during any free period of time and don't have to worry about teachers catching them. Although I would advise all teachers, before class to check every students' cell phone to make sure they are completely turned off and put away. This also includes the librarian checking for students cell phones also.

This policy also rewards some students who work hard in school, and deserve the usage of their phone. If you put this policy to good use, you, as the principal can find out what really is going on around the school. Getting updates from students talking about the latest news and what is soon going to happen. The teachers would also get many updates from their own students at what has been going on.

If needed, you, the principal has the right to check their cell phones for any purpose necessary and can confiscate them. Policy 1 can be put to good use if you imply some kind of other rules if needed too.

From,

A fellow student
