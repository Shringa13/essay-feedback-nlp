To whom it may concern,

I a citizen of the United States Of America would like to voice my opinion, on behalf of the Electoral college I think the Electoral college shall stay put. A while back the founding fathers established it in the constitution as a compromise between election of the president by a vote in congress and election of the president by a popular vote of quallified citizens. which means the tradition have lasted for decades and it shall not end now it shall remain forever. If there is no more Electoral college it would not be fair because we would not be able to vote for the president we desire. Who knows who will become the president then! Not only will we not be able to vote for the president of the United States of America but we wont be able to vote for the vice president, governor, senates...

ETC

. That would not be fair, all that hard work and dedication that people put in to help the women stop sacrificing and vote and you all are going to put it to waste, you will not only dissapoint us but you will dissapoint the people who led women to vote. I dont think the founding fathers established the constitution for decerations I think the established it with a purpose.

Under the 23rd Amendment of the U.S. constitution, the District of Columbia is allocated 3 electors and treated like a state for purpose of the

Electoral College.
