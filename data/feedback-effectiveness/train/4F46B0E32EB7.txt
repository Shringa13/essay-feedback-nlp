I think that we should be able to use our cell phones during lunch periods and other free time. It would allow the students to call parents in time of need. Such as if they are injured they can use their phone to cell their parents. Other students need medicine. Many children have diabetes. And having their phone allows them to call their parents.

Reason 1.) When students are injured/hurt , such as breaking occurs, they can call their parents and to let them know what happened so they can go to the doctor.

Reason 2.) Some students have diabetes, so they have to have a needle. It may break, or not work right, and need another one.

Reason 3.) Some kids may be abused and not want to tell a guidance counselor or teacher. So they can use their friends phone to call safe place, or 911.

Reason 4.) It allows freedom. Some kids are rebellious. So, when someone tells them something, they go against it. Having a phone sometimes helps this situation.

Having their phones out in class periods, should result a consequence. Likewise, taking it up for a day, detention, calling parents, and so on. Having a phone is a privilege, children should know that. It is also a responsibility. It teaches kids, like me, to respect your elders in whatever situation God hands them.
