Luke was at his part time job when his friend Don came in and said (do you want to come on a cattle boat trip with me.) Luke knew it was a opportunity of a life time and couldn't say no. Luke was 18 before he arived in Greece which meant he could be drafted for military service.

When the draft board learned he was on a cattle baot trip they said that he was able to keep going on the cattle boat trip. The cattle boat trip was an unbeleivable opportunity for a small towns boy like hime.

Luke helped out on his aunt Katie's farm whch prepared him for hard work but not for the dangers at sea. Luke also found a way to have fun on board even on return trips after the animals had been unloaded.

When Luke got home he was very grateful that he was able to go on the trip. To the cowboys it was an adventure but to Luke it was a opportunity to open up a whole new world. And that awareness stayed with him, leading his family to host of intternational students and exchange visitors for many years.
