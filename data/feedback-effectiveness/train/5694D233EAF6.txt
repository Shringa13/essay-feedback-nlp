The Electoral College basically serves as a filter for the votes of every individual American citizen. Every single vote that comes from citizens is a vote for somebody else who will be voting for the president, not the candidates themselves. The Electoral College is flawed to the point where the most logical way to vote would be to base presidental elections off of popular votes.

The Electoral College encourages the presidents who are running for office to avoid campaigning towards states with a smaller amount of electoral voters. If the president is determined by the most electoral votes, it would make sense that the president would campaign towards larger states with more electoral voters such as California, Texas, and Florida. Why would they spend time trying to appeal to some of the smaller states? This can lead to some states not even seeing the candidate. Infact, during the 2000 election, voters in the 25 largest media markets did not witness any campaign advertising.

The Electoral College's process of voting suppresses the voice of every citizen. The balance between smaller and larger states comes into play here as well. Take Florida for example, a state with 29 total electoral votes. If the mass majority of Florida votes for a certain set of electors, the minority votes for the other ones would not matter at all, as the electors speaking for that certain fraction of the population would not elected. With popular voting, each and every vote would matter towards electing a president. The number of minority votes would directly apply to the outcome of the president.

The Electoral College and the electors should not be the voice of the country. The voice of the people should be heard, especially when it comes to presidental elections. Popular voting is the most fair and rational method of voting. The Electoral College is best off forgotten as a voting system.
