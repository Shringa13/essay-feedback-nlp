If i was to be voted for president i would like to be voted by Electoral College because , electoral college is not voted for the presidents it is voted for the electors , who in turn elect the president . In conclusion , each candidate running for president in your state has thier own group of electors. There are somethings wrong with the electoral college like , american people dont consider themselves lucky with any election that happens. Americans are not grateful cause they might not have wanted the same president or wanted different electors. If you wanted to be president and you had good electors people all over the world would vote for you just because the electors you got. Americans vote for you to get the electors , i believe that is not good for our state because the electors of the president can switch the statements of one another. The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational. The electoral is Abolish !

in 1968 , a shift of 41,971 votes would have deadlocked the election. In 1976, there would be a tie of 5,559 voters in Ohio and 3,687 voter in Hawaii . At the most basic level the electoral college is unfair ! The electoral is Abolish !
