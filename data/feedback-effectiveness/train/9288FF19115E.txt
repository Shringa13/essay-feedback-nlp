Dear Principal

Sometimes when children get kick out of school they do Community Service. I think all school's should make they children do Community Service. It's something to keep them busy and keep them out of trouble. Community Service is one of they punishments we have.

Well to start it off. Community Service is a important thing to do. It keep your culture looking wonderful. Most of the times you can do community service just by helping someone with they yard work. Its a activity for most people. My brother love doing community service , he love people , and the people love him. Community Service help a lot of minors that need something to do , and i think that will help most of them do right. Most of the time you see men doing Community Service by picking up trash or helping someone with a house. I think Community Service will keep some of them out of trouble. Its a policy for some people to do community Service if they get kick out of school, because the judge probably told them they had to do Community Service.

Community Service is like helping someone stay out of trouble. Keep you busy at all times and doing the right things. It Keep you from doing the wrong thing at the wrong time. Community Service is like a job, but you not getting paid out of it. Most of time some people can do community service by doing the right thing or they can do something with they life by doing community service.

Community Service is a activity , and i think we should do Community Service.
