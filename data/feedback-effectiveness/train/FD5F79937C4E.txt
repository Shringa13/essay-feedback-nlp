The argument of "would this technology be valuable in a classroom setting" seems like it is very one sided.

Yes, this technology would be 100% valuable in a class room enviroment. And in the article it give a reason why it is so valuable! "A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored," "Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."

With these two reasons we can determine the value that they would have in schools. grades would get better, some may inspire to work harder because someone or something can tell they are confused and need help. Another quote that can support my claim is that "Most human communication is nonverbal,including emotional communication," "so computers need to under stand that, too." What this means is that the one kid who is afraid to speak up and ask questions or the kids who cant speak at all will get better help, because the computers can identify what emotions they are feeling and help them.

A drawback to having the technology in the classroom could mean that we could give off the wrong emotions and confuse the computer it self. and this could mean ruining the techology or worse. Another drawback would be that in paragraph seven it states "Your home PC can't handle the comples algorithms used to decode Mona Lisa's smile." this means that we would have to have advanced technology inside of a classroom, And if it is more younger kids its going to be super hard to keep it from being ruined or broken. Another set back would be People who suffer from Depression, Bipolar or PTSD can change emotions constantly and quickly.

This is why FACS (Facial Action Coding System) CAN be used in a classroom enviroment as well as being succsesful in said enviroment.
