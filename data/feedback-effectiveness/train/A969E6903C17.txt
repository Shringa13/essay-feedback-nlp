In the article ''Unmasking the Face on Mars''

NASA talks about how a spacecraft was circling the planet mars snapping possible landing sites for another spacecraft. When it suddenly spotted a shadowy likeness of a human face it seemed to be smiling back at the cameras.

The likeness face of a human most of been a rock formation as said in the article or a landing of an spacecrft or even from a take off but there so no such thing as aliens that would do that or they don't even exists. They even mentioned in the artilce how the cameras on board of MGS had to peer through wispy clouds to see the face clearly but skeptics a different thing. That pobably aliens makings were being hidden by the haze. Which were not likely it could of been the air,because the human like face was located in the north martian latitude where it was already winter. It could of been the breeze from the snow.

Who would think that aliens would do that if they knew we were going to spot it evenutly. The picture that was taken in 2001 was more bigger and more proseize on what we would of been looking at then it was in 1976. The picture that was taken in 2001 made people see that there was nothing to worry about and that it was just a rock looking like a face. People even made it famous without knowing what it was at the time but then people saw the picture takened in 2001 that they had nothing be afraid of or suprised.
