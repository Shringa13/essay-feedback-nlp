Dear,

State Senator,

I argue in the favor of keeping the electoral college. I think that it really doesn't matter what a single person vote can do. One vote will not make a difference. The state uses the americans vote, to see what we would pefer. Every vote an



important

' person makes, it counts that.

I personally think its a waist of time to vote,that us americans really have no say so in. I bet that if we all didn't vote this next go around, we would still have a president. All because, of what the



important

' people want. All 538 electors know who is better for the United States of America. So, why we vote?

The only thing against the electoral college, is what we might call the

Disaster Factor.

Back, in 1960, segregationist, in the Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with the new electors who would oppese John F. Kennedy. (So that a popular vote for Kennedy would not have actually gone to Kennedy.)

The Electoral College is widely regarded as an anachronism. a non-democratic method of selecting a president that ought to be {overruled} by declaring the candidate who receives the most popular votes the winner. The advocates of this position are correct in arguing the the electoral college method id not democratic in a modern sense. It is the electors who elect the president. NOT the people. When you cote for a presidential candidate you're actaully voting for a slate of electos. So, you might as well just let the electoral collge do the job. I mean if you want to go and vote mor power to you. But, like I said its a waist of time to do so!!!

Thank you for reading,

Ashlee
