Candidate what do you think of when I say that word well If I had to guess a said president. President that when  each party selects a president that the people  trust to help this Nation. candidates focuse their campaign on efforts onthe toss up state. In the article they said Nixonin 1968 and Clintin in 1992 both had only a43 percent plurality of the popular votes. No c candidate win majority.

Did you know that under 23rdAmendment of the constistution the district of columbia is allocated 3 electors and treated like a state for purposes of the electoral college. That what the article told me in paragraph4. Every candidate that is running for president has his or her own group of electors. the majority of 270 electoral votes is rerequired to elect the president. Everyone has to vote if want somebody that own your side. If don't then your voice will never be heard so you have speak up and vote. For who should be president of the state. So voting is a big deal so you make sure that you be heard.
