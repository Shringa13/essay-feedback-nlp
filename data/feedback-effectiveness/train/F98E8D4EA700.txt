The advantages of limiting car usage is they have less greenhouse gas emissions, being less tense and more accessible to public transportation.

The good thing about less greenouse gas emissions is the air is more dense and is a huge impediment to currrent efforts to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipes. Also another advantage is being less tense and a good thing about being less tense in can reduce high blood pressure, lesser chance for heart attack for people 40 or older, and you won't be so stressed because stress is a main cause for heart attacks and high blood pressure. Finally, the good thing about it being more accessible to public transportation is its just like carpooling everyone can ride in one vehicle and use less gas to make the air more dense and clear so the less gas you can use the better the air will be more clear so everyone can breathe in clean air for their lungs but if you don't like to use public transportation use you can always walk, jog, or even run because it's a great way to excersize your muscles.
