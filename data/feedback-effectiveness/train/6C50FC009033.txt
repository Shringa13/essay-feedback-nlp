Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president.

Dear state senator we should get rid of the Electoral College for many reasons.

One reason is that small states do not get any attention from the upcoming presidents because their electoral votes for the small states are to small like Alaska only has 3 electoral votes unlike California which has 55 electoral votes so the upcoming presidents can just not even think about the small states and go for bigger states like Florida, Texas, and California.

People say "The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational" and Bob Dole said "Abolish the electoral college." Many things can go wrong in the electoral college like their can be a tie in the sytem where is would be thrown to the House of Representatives, where state delegations vote on the president.

Another reason is what some people call the disaster factor, consider that state legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors, and that those electors could always defy the will of the people. who would vote for some one to not listen to them and do what they want? then the electoral college is useless in the sense of voting for who you want.

people say that the electoral college avoids run-off elections, however the electoral college is unfair to voters, because of the winner-take-all system in each state.
