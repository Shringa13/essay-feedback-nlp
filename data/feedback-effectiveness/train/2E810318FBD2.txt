Your principal has decided that all student's must participate in at least one extracurricular activity.

I do agree that student's should at least do one activity like help work on the year book's, sports,student council, etc. If i had to pick one activity it would be student council because i can help people like if their going through tough times. Say if they have trouble in school, try to help them with there grade's, or maybe the lost a love one. I would convince other to support me because i listen to people about what wrong or if there going thought something. I care about people feelings and i won't say anything in tillÂ there done.

Why do i want to do this is because say if your mom,dad,granddad, or grandma die in a car crush wouldn you be upset because that's your family member or maybe they die of the corona would you be upset you would want a councilor, brother, or sister. What i'm trying to say is that people need a council to help them out. Ok say that a truck smash your house wouldn't you be in shock in that case you would need a council right.

What i trying to say is that i want people to support me to do what i want to do, like say i want to help people out through family problem or like a love one die of cancer, heart attack, car crush, etc. I would be there to help them through there problem. it would be my honor to help people out.

Your principal has decided that all student's must participate in at least one extracurricular activity. I would do anything to help out people in need for what ever they want me to here i will be there for there need or whats i will be there in spirit.
