Dear Principal

Students should take community service because it will take away time from learning in class and not enough time to finish any work. Some teacher say this is good because teacher want there students to go take care of there community but education is more important because it will help u get into college and help make money to support your family. on the other community service is good because it help makes a better community and a better life.

parents wants there kids to go to school because they want there kids to have a better education then, them when there were kids and have a better life. so they don't have to do or find there way around things. parents want there kids to have a easier life. if students don't go to school this there is no reason to even have schools in the first place and just clean the community every day like its a job and don't get paid at all. its better to go to school because when you get to you are paid to go to school. not like its free and you want or you don't want. now this days students, will do anything to get out of class and out of school. students would fly school because they want to give away there one and only chance to find a good job. they would even try to get in trouble and get sent home and there parents don't care if they do that or even if the teacher calls them and say that ur kid however some may say that community is better because it keeps the community a better places to live but some teachers and parents disagree with this because teachers are like your second parents and they want u to go to school then do community service.

some may say that school is important because its good that students have a high education to get there degree. that is way people been going to school and that way the community have school and the main point of have school is to help students.
