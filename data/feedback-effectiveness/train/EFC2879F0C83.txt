Hello, (Insert State Senators name),

My name is PROPER_NAME.

A very popular topic that has been floating around in recent political conversations is the process, or in more familiar terms: fairness, in the steps used in the Electoral College to select a President for the United States of America. Or, perhaps ironically so, lack therfore of directly selecting a President. It is this particular topic that has inquired me to send you this letter regarding the upcoming debate: Should the Electoral College Stay Or Go?

Now don't get me wrong here: I legitimately don't believe anything I say could really have a major impact on any type of consideration towards this debate, I just hope you read this and ponder it's words to fully make a positive choice-whichever path you choose to side with in this. Our Forefathers created the Electoral College because they believed it to be the best method in securing a true democratic result for the leader of the USA. People say that the Electoral College is outdated because the times have moved on... well then, if that's true, I suppose we should just drop America's image of Freedom because it was made by some stupid old guys. Ummm... No. It is LOGICAL that true DEMOCRACY would be the greater portion of the PEOPLE that VOTE for the PRESIDENT. The opposite side of this argument says that it is unfair some of the states are skipped over because defeat is guarenteed. Defeat is guarenteed... don't people understand what that means? Here, let me explain it to you guys reeeeeeeeeeeeall simple so you can understand it: 1+1=2. ther ya go. job well done.
