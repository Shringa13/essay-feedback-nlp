I think the auther is being very un biased about wether or not we should go to venus. It can be riducolusly dangorous and will kill anyone that steps foot on venus. They talk about how Venus is hotter then Mercery which si the planet closest to the sun. Venus is hotter because of the pressure and dnesity that the atomoshere carries.

Also the fact that the pressure is so bad that if you but a submerne on Venus it would instantly liquafy as if it was nothing. That makes a great deal when trying to get there. Id otn doubt that anyone is not finding out the mos that they can when going to venus but I dint really think it would be a great idea sense there isnt much chance of survival. Going to Mars sound my relable to me. The idea of hovering over venus would make much more sense do to the fact that anyone who steps foot on Venus would most likley die. But there must be tons of risks to even just hovering over the planet.

I do belive that we should study venus but i dont think we should do it at the expensie of peoples lives. Maybe we could invent a high tech rover ot explore the outside of venus. People dying probably wouldnt help anything. Stuying it from affar is the best way for things to go without people dying.
