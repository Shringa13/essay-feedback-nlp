Dear principle.

The students of your school as well as I think you should go with policy 1 and allow cell phones during lunch and free times. We think this because when there is lunch that's our time and when there is free time that is also our time. During our time means that we will bother no one and do what we feel is fun, just like you would do what you want on your free time. Cell phones will cause no harm to your school , should they be put away properly. Cell phones during free time can be very helpful to students in predicaments where they need to call someone for an predicament such as

A student needing to call home for or projects

A student needing to call for an emergency

A student who needs to call home for notes

Or simply a students who needs a little happiness because their down

These are some of the reasons why cell phones should be allowed during lunch and free time. I hope you understand from a students way of vision and see that these are very important reasons why cell phones should be allowed during lunch and free time.

sincerely, a concerned student
