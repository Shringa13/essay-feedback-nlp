Students around the world say that they hate school and rather stay home well, here's and option students finally can. There is an ongoing debate that students should take online classes rather than being in school. Those who disagree state students should go to school because they will meet new people and it would improve their social skills but this is not true. Although some may disagree it would be more beneficial for students to participate in online classes.

They are various reasons why students should participate in online classes. Students would have less behavior problems because, they are not around other students to cause problems. Also, it would be more likely for students to pay attention if they don't have as many distractions that being in school causes. Students would be in their houses so, it would be easier for them to stay focus and stop them from causing disruptions.

They are further reasons why students should participate in online classes. Student's are in school for hours they will focus better if they are in a more comfortable environment. Maybe some students are introverts, being in school causes stress and pushes students to do things they don't want. Student's are more likely to participate if they are under less stress.

Finally, it would be more beneficial for students to participate in online classes due to, less behavior problems, easier for students to pay attention, and it's less time consuming. Those who disagree state students should go to school because they will, meet new people and it would improve their social skills but this is not true. I believe that it would be better if students participated in online classes rather than being in school.
