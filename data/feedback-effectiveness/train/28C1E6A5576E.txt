Senator, I argue in favor of changing to election by popular vote for the president of the united states. I argue in that favor because not everyone get's to vote for an electon. If keeping the Electoral College the same, the there will never be a way where when everyone will get the chance to vote. The Electoral College is very unfair for not letting everyone vote. Those people that work that process just go to places that they know they will get a vote.

Also, the Electoral College should change the election by poplular vote for the president of the United States because, when choosing your's elctors when you vote for your candidate you are actually voting for your candidate's electors. The people do not vote for president, the electors are who vote for president. When people think they are voting for president candidate, they are actually voting for slate of electors.

There's five reason to where the Electoral College should be retraining. Thse five main reasons are because 1) Certainy of Outcome, dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College vote is possible. 2)Everyone's President, requires a presidential to have trans-regional appeal. 3)Swing States, the winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes induces the candidates. 4)Big States, restores the weight in political balance that loose by virtue. 5)Avoid Run-Off Elections, avoides the problem of election in which they have no candidate.

They just go to states where they will get votes, they know that other states will have no affect to them when getting no vote. Im guessing that they get their hopes up? They dont give other people a chance to vote.
