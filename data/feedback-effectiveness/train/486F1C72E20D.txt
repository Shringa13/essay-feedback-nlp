To me I think we should change the election by popular vote for the president because the citizens deserve to vote on who ever they think will help are country. If they make the wrong decsion the it would be there fault and they wouldnt have no one else to blame but themselves for choosing that president or who ever they wanted to win. Also, if the person does make a mistake they should be able to unelect them also cause people need what is best for are country.

When people elect the president they usally go back through there speaches and see what they had promised for our country and make sure it is what they want. If it is not what they want they would probably go to the next person who is trying to be the president. When you are electing always make sure you are mking the right decision and make sure that they please you because they could elect that person because of yur vote you never no what could happen when voting.

Do you think it would be a good idea to elect someone who you are not sure about ? Well i dont think it is because they made the country to a bad situation or even smething dangerous like a war. But if they did keep the Electoral College i dont think they would care about the citizens of the united states I think that they would only care bout themselves and whats gonna please them and not everyone else.
