The author supports his story very well i think. He knows what he's talking about to be able to wright a story over it. It's something that he's probably always been into in his life! There weremany facts in there i had no idea about. It was just interesting to read about how it was so much different then what is on Earth then it was on Venus. Venus is 90 degrees more hot then what it is here. In that case the heat up there is definaly more powerful then what it is on earth. The author was testing many of different kinda examples to test them. The author has put everything in the right order so that it easyer to understand how it's going. This planet is more so off by it's so that its not so close to I think it would be interesting to read more of his books to see if he's that intot it with those too or it's just that one book that they have!
