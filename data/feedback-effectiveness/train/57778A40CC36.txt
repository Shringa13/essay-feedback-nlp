i tthink we shouldnt be able to have technology read are emotions if we dont want it to. in the artical its does a 3-d computer model of your face. and they didnt get all the emotions that everyone might have like some people have deprrison and some might have the feeking of blah but you guys wouldnt know because you dont have that as a oppsion on there.

they talk about how a home pc cant handle the complex algorithms used to decode someone simle. i think that should make it where no matter what you use it on it can run it. with out having to write it down .

what if someone is fake smiling. is your technology going to be able to tell if your really happy or not? I think it not a good idea because one it doesnt tell you all the emotions that the person is feeling and what if the person doesnt want one or doesnt like it and they aloud ti get rid of it or do they have to keep it. I know i wouldnt want someone else to tell me my emotions so i surely dont want some technology telling me how i feel .
