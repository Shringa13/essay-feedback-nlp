Dear principle,

I think it is a good idea to make students do some community service. Some people around here need help and if we do this we could help very many families around the state. After school at least 3 times a week we can help a family or person in need.

Kids think that doing this is stupid and they shouldn't have to, but we all need to step up and help out the community. We could give away toys, clothes, and anything else we don't want, don't need, or could be helpful to someone else. Or we could send out ten people to go to every school in the county and read books to people in 1st, 2nd, and 3rd grade. Some of us can work in a soup kitchen whenever they are free.

Maybe sometime we can have an assembly at our school and we can hire a public speaker to tell us about how helping the community can help us and everyone else! This could be a great idea. And remember it only takes a few people to make a difference! Thank you and have a great day!

sincerely, STUDENT_NAME
