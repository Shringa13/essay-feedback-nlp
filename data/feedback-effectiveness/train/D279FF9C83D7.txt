Are driverless cars the right choice for our future? No i believe that they are not the right thing for our future, because they seem unsafe and our country is already lazy enough. Yes there are some pros to building driveless cars, but there are also cons as well.

In paragraph nine it states that "our traffis laws for our states are under the assumpiton that the only safe way for a car is to have a human under control", and thats beause our traffic laws are based on human error. So basically if a said law is broken then the human gets the bad end of the deal, but if its a driverless car who will get the blame for a traffic law being broken the company that made it or the owner of the driverless car? Also in paprgraph 7 it basically said the car can drive its self unless if it needs human help and that the driver must always has his or her hands on the wheel. Basically saying we are able to regain control if needed, but what if we couldn't because the car is acting up and then we get injured or get others hurt. So what I am trying to say is you never know if its safe.

So think about it. Do you think that driverless cars are right for our future or no?
