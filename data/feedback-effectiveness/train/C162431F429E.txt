I like this feature. I'd consider it very helpful on both computers and robots. Regarding robots, I wonder if Baymax from Disney's "Big Hero 6" had something like it. He was like a robotic nurse as explained by the main character. However, it wouldn't work in concrete tunnels.

Regarding computers, if the feature could have come out a bit sooner, then Nickelodeon could've used it for a non-animated TV show they came out with, called "I Am Frankie". I'm still waiting for the show to continue. In one of the last two episodes of this show, one of the judges for this competition that was like a quiz show said that computers can't feel human emotions, but a girl who was part computer proved her wrong. I like this show because it gives me proof of how smart computers are.

In conclusion, this feature should be used in all computers. I'd like for it to be used in robots too, that way robots could take the expression and mimic it. I'm pretty sure the "Transformers" movies have something like it too. If the "Transformers" movies and "Big Hero 6" use it then it was probably already thought of. With computers, someone could type into the computer "How am I feeling today?" and the computer could respond with an emotion like said computer has ESP.
