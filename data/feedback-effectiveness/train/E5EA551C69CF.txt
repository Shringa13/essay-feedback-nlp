If it is not broken why should we fix it? The electoral college system has been with us for as long as we have had presidents and one flaw if going to make us scrap eveything? There are many ways to fix the electoral college and throwing the system in the trash should be the last resort.  Although the election of 2000 is an example of a problem that shoud be fixed it is not a reason to do away with the system.

To commence with, the electoral college is a fine system that has easily fixed flaws such as the election of George W. Bush versus Al Gore in which Gore won the popular vote while still losing the whole election. An obvious solution to this problem could be what Nebraska and Maine are doing and introducing proportional representation as opposed to the "winner-take-all" system. Also if we were to switch from the electoral college it would take citizens time to get used to the new stystem. Although the electoral college seems unreliable there is a certainty of outcome to it, while some people dispute over the outcome of the vote it is likely an arguement about the popular vote.

Although we have had the system for so long and it has been reliable and there are ways to fix it some people would still like to move away from it and create a new system.  If we were to shift from the electoral college to another way to vote what would we have, a voting system fully based on popular votes? no, because a popular vote system would rely too much on citizens being able to make informed decisions which would result in unreliable outcomes.

Henceforth, the electoral college is a reliable system with easily fixed flaws, therefore we should not fix or replace the system. If the electoral college was to be replaced there would be pandemonium as to what system shall replace it, how we will adapt to the new system, and if the system is an improvement or a step back in innovation and our future leaders.
