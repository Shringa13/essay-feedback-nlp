Have you ever had a project to do over summer break? well I've never had to do a project over summer break, I personally would prefer for my project to be a student designed cause, you can choose from a variety of ideas, also it would show more creative projects, last it would be different ideas. Well, having a project to do over summer break is a great Idea to keep students brains functioning. If the project is teacher designed all students would have the same topic. I prefer my project to be student designed cause you can choose from a variety of different topics, which you would do your project.

Second, with the project being student designed it would be more creative for students. different students are going to do their projects on different topics, If I had to do this project I would be very creative, And show lots of neatness, Also I would turn my project in on time. Third, with the project being student designed it would be a lot of different ideas students can choose from student would also have time on their projects. Last, having a project over summer break is a good opportunity for students it wouldn't hurt to learn while on break would it? A student designed project wouldn't stop your project it would be more creative, and it would also bring different ideas to the table.   Â
