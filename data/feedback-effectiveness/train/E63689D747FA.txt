Arguing about keeping the electoral college would have to be the best oppition. The process of the electoral college is a meeting of electors that vote forpresident and vice president. I think that the people should help out with this voting like all we do is give them advice. When this is done the people that voted are picking the right person to protect our country. And when we vote for your new president you are actually voting for the candidate's electors.

In maine and nebraska they are differnet form every other state they dont do the winner takes all they have a differnet system. When the president is elected he gets a certifacation of all the people he beat. I think thats wrong I think that everyone that fought in this election should get a little thing. Jimmy carter, bob dole, and others all agreed that electoral college should be abolished. In this election 60 percant of people voted not to have a electoral college.

When voters are voting on the new president they are actally voting for the state of electors. If your voting in texas for someone that is running you wouldn't be voting for them you would be voting for the democratic electors. The best argument against the electoral college would have to be the disaster factor. In 2000 there was a election crisis that broke out it was the biggest one. The states leislatures are technically responsible for picking the electors and picking this people they can defy eneyone.

Back in 1960 a louisiana legislature succeeded in replacing the democratic elector with a new one. Electors had refused to vote for their party's candidate and it happened in hawaii 1960. The vice president at the time had made sure that everything was back to normal.       Â
