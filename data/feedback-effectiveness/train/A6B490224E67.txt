In 1976 Viking fly to Mars, and when they orbit/circle the mars they see a big head that look like pharoah head.

I think that the head was form by itself when the heat from Mars rise and it burn some of the rock and form the big head. I don't think it was made by alien because if they were in Mars they would burn when the sun come or when the heat rise from Mars. If it were made by alien then we would see their foot print or some symbol or marking that is unusual to Earth. The people who was there to take this photo said it was "Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa-landforms common around the American west". It said that on "April 5, 1998, Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time, Michael Malin and his Mars orbiter camera (MOC) team snapped a picture 10 time sharper then the original Viking photo". "There was no alien monument after all". So, the head was created by landform and if there were alien they would have seen them or take a photo of them but there was none so it was created by landform.

In conclusion, the head that was on Mars was actually created by landform, not by alien because if it was created by alien then they would have seen them when they orbit the Mars and also it is not alien monument it is actually the "Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa-landforms common around the American west".
