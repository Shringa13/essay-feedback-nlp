Dear Principal,

Hi my name is STUDENT_NAME.

i am one of the students that goes to your school. I wanted to talk to you about the cell phone policy. I think you should go with policy 1.

We would bring cell phones to school but they would be turned off during class and would be only used on lunch periods or free times. Some people might not follow that policy but it would sure help out a lot.

One of the reasons why i would go with policy 1 is that there could be an emergency somewhere in the school and nobody knows about it and you have a cell phone with you, you could call the office or a teacher. Or when somebody got hurt real bad and they have no information or number for your parent or guardian, but you have a number of their family members or friends, it would really help.

Even though students have their cell phones out during class and in the hallways. There would be an emergency one day and somebody has a cell phone with them, it helps.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
